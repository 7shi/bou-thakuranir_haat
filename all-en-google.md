Bou-Thakuranir Haat

# Chapter 1

It's late at night. summer time The wind has stopped. Even the leaves of the tree are not moving. Prince of Jasohara, Pratapaditya's eldest son, Udayaditya is seated on the bed of his bed. By his side is his wife Surma.

Surma said, "My dear, bear with me, bear with me. One day the happy day will come."

Udayaditya said, "I want no more happiness. I want, if I were not born in a royal palace, if I were a prince, but the smallest subject of Yashohara-lord, his eldest son, the only heir to his throne, all his riches, and all his glory." I wouldn't have done it! If you do penance, all this past can be reversed!"

Surma was very irritated and took Yuvraj's right hand in both hands and pressed it, and looked at his face and sighed slowly. You can give your life to fulfill the prince's wish, but even if you give your life, you will not be able to fulfill this wish, this is sorrow.

Yuvraj said, "Surma, I could not be happy just because I was born in the king's house. In the king's house, everyone is born only as an heir, not as a child. My father has been testing me every moment since my childhood, whether I can maintain his earned wealth or not, the face of the family." Whether I will be able to shine or not, whether I will be able to carry the weight of the kingdom or not. He is looking at me with the eyes of test, every gesture, not with the eyes of love. Relatives, ministers, royal councilors, citizens are calculating my future by taking every word and deed. All shook their heads and said-- No, the kingdom will not be saved by me in this danger. I am stupid, I do not understand anything. Everyone started neglecting me, the father started hating me. He completely abandoned my hope. He did not even look for me.

Surma's eyes watered. He said, "Ah! How could you!"

He was sad, he was angry, he said, "Those who thought you were stupid are stupid."

Udayaditya smirked, grabbed Surma's chin and shook Arktim's face in anger. He became serious in a moment and said, "No, Surma, the truth is that I have no sense of governance. It has been tested enough. When I was sixteen years old, the Maharaj handed over the Hossainkhali Pargana to me to teach me. Within six months, chaos began to ensue. .The taxes decreased, the subjects began to bless. The servants began to complain against me to the king. Everyone in the royal assembly agreed that when the prince has become so beloved by the subjects, it is clear that he will never be able to rule the kingdom. He would not look at one. He would say -- And Kulangar will be just like Raigarh's Khura Vasant Ray, playing the sitar and dancing and will bring down the state."

Surma again said, "Beloved, endure, be patient. Be a thousand, father is not. These days his whole heart is filled with the only desire of kingdom-acquisition, kingdom growth, there is no room for affection. The more his hopes are fulfilled, the more his hopes are fulfilled. The kingdom of love will be at home."

Yuvaraj said, "Surma, your intellect is sharp and far-sighted, but this time you have misunderstood. One is that there is no end to hope; secondly, the more the limit of the father's kingdom is at home, the more the kingdom is gained, the more the fear of losing it will remain at home in his mind; The more serious you become, the more you will find me unsuitable for him."

Surma did not misunderstand, only mistrusted; Faith also violates reason. He hoped that this would be the case.

"Couldn't bear the sight or the neglect anywhere around me, I would sometimes run away and go to my grandfather in Raigarh. Father didn't look for much. Ah, what a change. I could see the trees there, I could go to the villagers' cottages, I didn't have to wear Divanishi Rajbesh. Apart from that, you know, where Dada Mahashay lives, neither sad thoughts nor strict seriousness can endure in his trisima. He fills the surroundings by playing the gahia, entertaining. All around is joy, goodwill, peace. Whenever I go there, I forget that I am the Prince of Jessohar. He What a mistake of comfort. Finally when I was eighteen years old, one day in Raigarh the spring breeze was blowing, green Kunjaban all around, in that spring I saw Rukmini."

Surma said, "I-I've heard that many times."

Udayaditya Listen again. Sometimes one word stings in the soul, if I don't let those words out, then how can I survive. I am still ashamed to say that to you, it hurts, so I say it again and again. The day I will no longer be ashamed, I will not suffer, I will understand that my atonement is over, I will not say it again.

Surma. What is atonement dear? If you have sinned, it is the fault of the sin, not your fault. Do I not know you? Can't see your heart?

Udayaditya began to say, "Rukmini is three years older than me. She is a lonely widow. She used to live in Raigad by grandfather's grace. I don't remember by what trick she first attracted me. Then the light of midday was burning in my mind. Such a bright light that , I could not see anything well, the world around me was covered with a celestial vapor. All the blood seemed to rise to the head; nothing was surprising, nothing seemed impossible; the way was wrong, the direction was all one shape. I had never experienced this before, nor after this. It has never happened to me. Jagadishvara knows what purpose He has set the whole world against this small, feeble, mindless heart for one day, as if the world had united and led this little heart of mine astray for a moment. For a moment--no more-- — A momentary blow of all the outer world, And in a moment a feeble heart's root cleft, With lightning he fell embracing the dust. When he arose afterwards, Dusty gray, dim-- He dusted no more, He lifted no trace of filth. What did I do, God, that in one moment of sin, you blackened all the whites of my life? If you turn day into night? At the blossoming of my heart, even the faces of Malti and Jasmine became black with shame."

With every blow Udayaditya's fair face turned crimson, the oblong eyes widened, an electric flame trembled from head to foot. Surma said with joy, pride, pain, "Eat my head, O-talk."

Udayaditya As the blood gradually cooled, all could see the proper amount. What is the state of the mind when the world does not seem like a warm, whirling brain, a blood-sucking drunkard's crazy swirling dreamscape, but a real field of action! Fall from where! I fell into the abyss of hundreds of thousands of kroshas, blind, blind, blind, without blinking an eye. Grandpa lovingly called and took him, what did I say to him? But until then I had to leave Raigarh. Grandfather, you can't live without seeing me; He used to call me. I was so afraid that I could not go at all. He himself used to come to see me and sister Viva. No shame, nothing. He didn't even ask why I didn't go. He would see us, have fun and leave."

Udayaditya smiled and looked at Surma's face, flooding his big eyes with the most tender love. Surma understood what was coming this time. Face bowed down; Ishath became agitated. Yuvraj held her forehead with both hands and raised her bowed face. He went closer and sat; He put his face in his mouth slowly. He encircled Katidesh with his left hand and kissed her forehead with deep calm love and said, "What happened after that, Surma, tell me? From where did this bright face shine with intelligence, soft with love, bright with laughter and serenely radiant? I hope to break that deep darkness. What was it? You are my dawn, my light, my hope, what magical spell did you remove that darkness?"

Yuvraj repeatedly kissed Surma's face. Surma didn't say anything, her eyes filled with tears of happiness. The prince said, "After so long I found a proper shelter. I first heard from you that I was not stupid, I believed, and understood. It was from you that I learned wisdom. It is not like a dark alley, crooked up and down, but straight and wide like a highway. Before I hated you. I used to neglect you. I didn't dare to do anything. If the mind said, this is right, said self-doubt reform, it might not be right. I used to tolerate the way he was treated, I didn't try to think about anything myself. After all this time, I thought , I am something, I am who. So long I was invisible, you brought me out, Surma you discovered me, now I want to do what my heart says is good, immediately. I have such faith in you that when you believe in me , then I can also trust me without fear. Where was the strength in Sukuma's body that you have made me strong?

Surma hugged her husband's chest with immense trust. Key stared into his face with a look of total self-sacrifice. His eyes said, "I have nothing but you, so I have everything."

Since childhood, Udayaditya has come with the neglect of his relatives, sometimes he likes to discuss with Surma the old life story that has been told a hundred times, fragment by fragment, on the terrace.

Udayaditya said, "How long will Surma continue like this? Meanwhile, in the royal assembly, the members of the assembly are looking at me in a kind of kind way, while in Anthapura, mother is insulting you. Even the maidservants do not respect you. Go. Your bright nature, but bear it in silence. When I couldn't make you happy, you only had to endure insults and suffering from me, then it would have been better if we hadn't married."

Surma. What is he talking about? Surma is necessary at this time. What I could do to you during happiness! Surma is a luxury, a plaything during happy times. After overcoming all the sorrows, this happiness has arisen in my mind that I am of use to you, I am enjoying the joy that there is incomparable joy in suffering for you. This is only sorrow, why I could not bear all your sufferings.

The prince remained silent for some time and said, "I do not think so much of myself. All have gone well. But why should you suffer insults for me? Like a proper wife you have comforted me in times of sorrow, given me rest in times of toil, but like a husband I do not insult you." , from shame, I could not save you. Your father Sreepur-Raj does not want to accept my father as the chief, not to accept you as a subordinate of Jessoharchhatra, the father wants to maintain his headship by showing neglect towards you. He does not listen if anyone insults you. He thinks that the daughter-in-law he has made you, is enough for you. Once in a while, I feel like I can't get up anymore, abandon everything and take you with me. I would have gone by now, but you have only held me."

The night deepened. Many an evening star has set, many a deep night star has risen. The footsteps of the guards stationed in the prakara-toran can be heard from afar. The whole world is asleep. All the lights in the city have gone out, the doors are closed, there is not a single animal except a fox or two. The door to Udayaditya's bedroom was locked. Suddenly someone started knocking on the door from outside.

Busy Yuvraj opened the door, "Why Viva? What happened? Why did you come here at such a late night?"

Readers are already aware that Viva is Udayaditya's sister. Biva said, "So far I understand the destruction!"

Surma and Udayaditya asked together, "Why, what has happened?" Biva said quietly in a frightened voice. Couldn't stay talking anymore, cried, said, "Grandpa, what will happen?"

Udayaditya said, "I will go."

Viva said, "No no, you don't go."

Udayaditya Why Viva?

Biva Can the father know? If you are angry?

Surma said, "Shh Vivah; is now the time to think about it?"

Udayaditya dressed in robes and girded his sword and started to leave. Biva held his hand and said, "Dada, don't go, you send people, I am afraid."

Udayaditya said, "Biva do not interrupt now; there is no time." After saying this, he immediately went out.

Viva held Surma's hand and said, "What will happen brother? What if father finds out?"

Surma said, "What else will happen? I feel that there is nothing left of love. Even if what is there is gone, it will not be a big loss."

Biva said, "No brother, I am afraid. What if the father does some kind of harm. What if he punishes?"

Surma took a deep breath and said, "My faith, who has no help in the world, Narayan is the greatest helper. O Lord, may your name not be tarnished. Do not break this faith of mine."

# Chapter 2

The minister said, "Your Majesty, will the work be good?"

Pratapaditya asked, "What work?"

"What you ordered yesterday," said the minister.

Pratapaditya got annoyed and said, "What did I order yesterday?"

"About your parentage," said the minister.

Pratapaditya became more annoyed and said, "What about my parentage?"

The minister said, "Maharaj had ordered that when Basant Ray would take refuge in the tea of Shimultali on his way to Jessohar--"

Pratapaditya frowned and said, "Then what? Finish the conversation."

the minister Then two men went--

glory yes

the minister will kill him.

Pratapaditya got angry and said, "Minister, have you suddenly become a child? Why do you have to ask ten questions after hearing one word? I feel shy to speak the word! Now I feel that you are too old to pay attention to your royal affairs, now the time has come to think about the hereafter. Pray for a break." Why not?"

the minister Maharaj could not understand my feelings well.

glory I understand the delay. But I ask you one thing, what I can do, you can't even put it in your mouth? You ought to have considered, when I was going to do this, that there was, of course, a serious reason for it; Of course, I was thinking about religion and non-religion.

the minister Command Your Highness, I--

glory Shut up, listen to what I have to say first. When I did this - when I decided to kill my father, I thought more than you. There is no immorality in this work. This is my vow - the Mlechchas who have come to our country and started lawlessness, due to whose tyranny the traditional Arya Dharma is about to disappear from our country, the Kshatriyas are giving daughters to the Mughals, the Hindus are depraved, I will remove these Mlechchas, I will free our Arya Dharma from the grip of Rahu. . A lot of strength is required to fulfill this vow. I want all the kings of Bengal united under me; It will not be accomplished unless those who are allies of Yavana are destroyed. Patrivya Vasant Roy is my worshiper, but there is no sin in speaking the right words, he is the stain of our clan. Pratapaditya Ray has nothing to do with such a person who has accepted you as a servant of Mlechch. If wounded, one can cut off one's own arm; My wish is to cut the wound of the family, the wound of Bangladesh, and save the Ray-Bansa, save Bangladesh.

The minister said, "I did not differ with His Majesty in this matter."

Pratapaditya said, "Yes, it was. Speak correctly. It is still there. Look, minister, as long as your opinion does not coincide with mine, express it. If you do not have that courage, then this position is not yours. If in doubt, tell me. Time to explain to me. Give. You think it's always a sin to blaspheme your parentage; "Don't say 'no,' that's exactly what you're thinking." It has an answer. Bhrigu killed his mother at the request of his father, can I not kill my father at the request of religion?"

The minister had no opinion on this matter - that is, religion and non-religion. As far as the minister could go, the king could not go as far. Minister Bilakshan knew that if he showed any hesitation in the present matter, the king would be somewhat angry for the time being, but in the end he would be satisfied in his heart. If this is not done, the suspicion and fear of the king may arise against the minister.

The minister said, "What I was saying, Delhishwar will surely be angry after hearing this news."

Pratapaditya flared up, "Yes, he will be angry! Everyone has the right to be angry. Delhishwar is not my God. There are enough beings who will tremble and tremble if he gets angry, there is Mansingha, there is Birbal, we have Vasant Roy, and recently I see you too. Yes; but don't think of all the egos."

The Minister laughed and said, "Ajna, Your Majesty, I am not too afraid of empty fury, but if there is a shield and sword with it, one has to wonder what the book is. Delhi's fury means fifty thousand soldiers."

Pratapaditya could not give a good answer to this and said, "Look minister, don't try to deter me from doing any work by showing fear of Delhishwar, I feel absolutely insulted by that."

The minister said, "What will the people say if they know?"

glory Can you know?

the minister This work will not be pressed for long. If this news becomes a state, all of Bangladesh will be against you. The purpose for which you want to do this will be completely destroyed. You will be banished from the nation and will have to endure various hardships.

glory Look minister, I tell you again, I do what I do with special thought. Therefore, if I am inclined to work, don't try to discourage me by showing me some threats, I am not a child. I have not kept you as my own disciplinarian, to hinder me at every step.

The minister fell silent. The king had two orders for him. One, as long as there is a difference of opinion will be published; Secondly, do not try to dissuade the king from doing any work by expressing opposing views. Till date the Minister has not been able to properly adjust this order.

After a while the minister said again, "Maharaj, Dillishwar--" Pratapaditya got up and said, "Dilliswara again? Minister, if you recite the name of Dillishwar as many times as you can during the day, you would be able to finish the work of the afterlife. Until I finish this work. , until then do not bring the name of Delhishwar in your mouth. When I get the news of this work samadha this afternoon, then come near my ears and chant the name of Delhishwar. Until then, exercise some self-restraint."

The minister fell silent again. "Your Majesty, Prince Udayaditya..."

The king said, "Dilliswar is gone, the people are gone, now will you finally talk about that female boy and scare you?"

The minister said, "Your Highness, you are very mistaken. I have no intention of interfering with your work."

Pratapaditya said coldly, "But tell me what you were saying."

The minister said, "Yesterday night the prince rode off alone and has not yet returned."

Pratapaditya got annoyed and said, "In which direction did you go?"

"Eastward," said the minister.

Pratapaditya gritted his teeth and said, "When did you go?"

the minister It's almost midnight tomorrow.

Pratapaditya said, "Is the daughter of the zamindar of Sripur here?"

the minister command yes

Prominence It is better if he stays in his father's house.

The minister did not reply.

Pratapaditya said, "Udayaditya was never like a king. From childhood he mingled with the subjects. Who knew that my son would become like this? Do lion cubs have to be taught how to be lions? But - Naranang Matulakrama: I feel. He has acquired the nature of their maternal grandfathers. On top of that I recently married him in the house of Sripur; until then the boy has been quite degenerate. God, let my youngest son be worthy, if I cannot finish what I have begun, I will not be able to think of it at the time of death. As if. Hasn't he come back yet?"

the minister No sir.

Pratapaditya stomped on the ground and said, "Why didn't a guard go with him?"

the minister One was ready to go, but he refused.

glory Why didn't you go away invisibly?

the minister They did not suspect any wrongdoing.

glory Do not doubt! Minister, do you want to tell me, they did a great job? Minister, you can't try to explain anything to me in vain. The guards have been particularly negligent in their duties. Call and send whoever was at the door at that time. If any of my wishes for the event fail, I will perish. Minister, you too have the possibility of fear. You have come to prove to me that no one is responsible for this. But this is your responsibility.

Pratapaditya sent for the guards. After a while he asked seriously, "Yes. What were you talking about Delhi?"

the minister I heard that a complaint has been made in your name to Delhishwar.

glory who Is your Prince Udayaditya?

the minister Ajna Maharaj, don't talk like that. Can't find who did it.

glory Whoever does it, don't think too much for him, I am the judge of Delhishwar, I am the one who will punish him. He sent them not yet returned? Udayaditya has not come yet? Quickly call the guard.

# Chapter 3

Yuvraj's horse is galloping through the deserted path. The night is dark, but the road is long, straight and wide, so there is no fear. In the still night, the sound of horses' hoofs is echoing around, two dogs are barking and calling out, two jackals are startled and hide in the bamboo bushes. The stars of the sky in the light and the sycamores on the wayside trees; The restless sound of a rattlesnake among sounds, the skeletal remains of a man sleeping under a beggar's old tree. After crossing five crores of road, Yuvraj left the road and landed in a field. The speed of the horse had to be moderated. It had rained during the day, the ground was wet, and the horse's feet were sinking. The horse fell down three times on its front legs. The tired horse's nostrils flared, frothy at the mouth, foaming from the friction of the hind legs, a sound coming out of the cage, all sweaty. Meanwhile, a great summer, not a hint of wind, still a long way to go. After crossing many marshes and cultivated fields, the Prince finally came to a dirt road. He galloped the horse again. Once he squeezed his neck and called out with encouragement, "Sugriva." He cocked his ears once and looked at the Lord with big eyes, bowed his neck once and hummed, lowered his face and relaxed his rush, and bowed his neck and took a deep breath. The trees on both sides are not visible to the eye, looking at the sky, it seems as if the stars are flying like sparks in groups, and the stagnant air in the sky started to flutter and flicker near the ears. When it was the third watch of the night, when the jackals called the watch near the place, the prince came and stood at the door of Shimultali's chattel, and his horse immediately passed out and fell to the ground. Namia patted his back, held his face, called "Sugriva" how many times, he didn't move! Sighing, the prince went to the door and knocked. After repeated blows, the principal of the chatty did not open the door and said through the window, "Who are you at such a late night?" Saw an armed young man standing at the door.

Yuvraj said, "I will ask one thing, open the door."

He said, "What is necessary to open the door, what is to be asked, do not ask."

Yuvaraj asked, "Is Vasant Roy, king of Raigarh, here?"

He said, "Ajna, he was supposed to come after evening but he has not come yet. I think he didn't come today."

Yuvaraj took two coins and said, "Take this."

He hurriedly came and opened the door and took two coins. Then Yuvraj said to him, "Bapu, I will search your chat once and see who is there?"

"No, monsieur, it won't be," said the chat-keeper doubtfully.

Udayaditya said, "Don't interrupt me. I am an employee of the palace. I have come to search for two criminals."

Saying this he entered. The chatti-keeper did not stop him. He searched everything. Neither Basant Ray, nor his attendants, nor any Pathan could be seen. Only the two Suptothita Praudha cried out, "O death, why are you looking at Minse like that?"

After coming out of the chatty and standing on the road, Yuvraj began to think. Once he thought that it was good, maybe he couldn't come today by chance. He thought again, if he was in a previous chatty and the Pathans had gone there in search of him? Thinking like this, he started walking that way. When he went far, he saw a horseman coming from the opposite direction. When he came near, he said, "Who is he, Ratan or not?" He immediately got down from the horse and bowed to him and said "Ajna yes. Prince, are you here so late at night?"

Yuvraj said, I will tell you the reason later. Now tell me where Grandfather is.

"Ajna, he is supposed to stay in the chat."

"What is he! I didn't see him there."

He was surprised and said, "Maharaj has set out for Jessore with thirty retinues. I was lagging behind on business. It is about Miliba with him this evening at this chat."

"Footprints are supposed to be in the mud on the road, so I went in search of him. I took your neck. You come on foot."

# Chapter 4

Old Vasant Roy is sitting in an uncared-for earthen bed under a ashtha tree by the side of Bijan Path. There is no one else nearby, only a Pathan outside the camp. A throng of people mingled in the distance. Rajni was stunned. Vasant Roy asked, "Sir, why didn't you go?"

Pathan said, "Sir, what shall we do? You have sent all your attendants to protect our riches. I will leave you unprotected at night by the side of this road, so ungrateful do not disturb me. Our poet says, He who wrongs me is indebted to me; in the Hereafter." He will have to repay that debt; I am indebted to him who does me good, but I will never be able to repay him."

Vasant Roy said to himself, wow, the man is very good. After debating for a while, he stuck his bald head out of the palanquin and said, "Khan Sahib, you are a great and good man."

Khan Saheb immediately made a salam. There was no difference of opinion between Mr. Khan and Mr. Vasant Roy on this matter. Vasant Roy examined his face in the light of the torch and said, "You seem like a man of a big house."

Pathan saluted again and said, "Kya Tajjab, Your Majesty, you are right."

Vasant Roy said, "What do you do now?"

Pathan breathed out and said, "Lord, I am in dire straits, now I have to live by farming. The poet says, O blind man, the grass that you have turned into straw, your cruelty does not show in this, but the tree that you have turned into a tree and finally in the hands of the storm. Lay it flat with grass and sleep on it, I guess, your mind is made of stone."

Basant Roy was extremely happy and said, "Wow, wow, what a word the poet has spoken. Sir, the two verses that I have spoken today, I have to write them down."

Pathan thought, his vision is happy. Bura, lok baro sares; It will be of great use to the poor. Vasant Roy thought, ah, the person who was once a great man is now in such a plight. Chapla Lakshmi's big torture. In his heart, he felt a bit sad, said to Pathan, "You can easily join the army with the beautiful body you have."

The Pathan immediately said, "Sir, can I write? That is our job. My father and grandfather have all died by the sword, and I have that only knowledge. The poet says,-"

Basant Roy said with a smile, "Whatever the poet says, Bapu, if you accept my work, then you can die by the sword, but it will not be your fate to unsheath that sword. I am old, the people are happy and at ease, God bless you. , so that there is no need to fight anymore. Age is gone; I have left the sword. Now, instead of the sword, another has taken my water." Saying this, he woke up the sitar who was lying on the side with two bells.

Pathan shrugged and closed his eyes and said, "Ah, what you say is right. There is a saying that one can conquer the enemy with the sword, but one can make the enemy an ally with music."

Vasant Roy exclaimed, "What do you say, Khan Saheb? Music can make an enemy an ally! How wonderful!" He kept thinking for a while, the more he thought, the more surprised he became. After a while, he explained the story and said, "The enemy's enmity cannot be destroyed even with a sword, which is such a terrible thing - how can it be destroyed? How is it better to kill the patient and cure the disease? But music, which is such a sweet thing, destroys the enemy with it." Enmity can be destroyed even without doing it. Is this about ordinary poetry? What a compliment!" The old man got so excited that he stepped outside the camp, asked the Pathan to come closer and said, "The enemy can be conquered with the sword, but the enemy can be made friends with music, how is it, sir?"

send Command yes sir.

Vasant Roy. You go to Raigarh once. I will go back from Jessore and help you as much as I can.

Pathan cheered up, "You can do whatever you want." Pathan thought that somehow he had taken care of himself. asked, "Do you like to play the sitar?"

Basant Roy said, "Yes" and immediately picked up the sitar. Mezrap on her finger began to talk. Sometimes Pathan shook his head and said, "Wow! Khasi!" Gradually, under the influence of excitement, it became impossible for Basant Roy to sit in the Shivika. He stood up and started playing. Dignity and seriousness were soon forgotten and he finally sang, "Kayse katongi rayon, so piya bina."

When the song stopped, Pathan said, "What a wonderful sound."

Basant Roy said, "But I think everyone's voice sounds sweet in the quiet night, in the open field. Because, I have a great voice but people don't appreciate my voice much. But what's more, God has given one or the other medicine for all the diseases that he has given. Similarly, all the necklaces given have one or the other listeners. There are two Arbachins that I like. Otherwise, sir, I would have closed this necklace shop long ago; there are those two clumsy buyers, they don't know the goods, and they are the ones who sell them. I haven't seen them for a long time. , the hymns are also closed; therefore I am running away. I will return home after listening to the song with all my heart, taking down the burden of life." The old man's dim eyes shone with love and joy.

Pathan said in his heart, "Your sadh has been fulfilled, the song has been sung, now shall I take down the burden of life? You, you, do such things! There is merit in killing an infidel, but I have earned that virtue so much that I do not think much about the hereafter, but In the current state of affairs, I don't mind if we can get rid of this infidel without killing him.

Basant Roy could not remain silent for a long time, his imagination became excited-- he approached Pathan very quietly and said, "Who were I talking about, sir, know? They are my grandson and granddaughter." He became impatient, thinking - When will my followers come back? He started singing again with a sitar.

A man on horseback came near and said, "Oh, I'm saved. Grandpa, who are you singing to on the side of the road so late at night?"

In joy and wonder, Vasant Ray immediately placed his sitar on the shivika and took Udayaditya's hand down and embraced him firmly. He asked, "What's up, grandpa? Didi's okay?"

Udayaditya said, "All is good."

Then the old man with a smile picked up the sitar and began to sing, putting his feet to the rhythm and shaking his head.

"Bandhua untimely why O Prakash?

All that dream is faith.

You were in the corner of Chandrabali, where did you meet?

Are you in love with Mitil?

It's still night, it's not dawn yet,

Radhika has not finished crying yet.

Chandrabali Susumsa is now dry today?

Chokor, did you see the sweet smile of Chandramukh?"

Udayaditya looked at Pathan and asked Vasant Ray in his ear, "Grandfather, where did this confession come from?"

Vasant Roy quickly said, "Khan Saheb is a very good man. An understanding person. Tonight has been spent with great pleasure."

Seeing Udayaditya, Mr. Khan was very agitated, he could not think of what to do.

Udayaditya asked the grandfather, "Why are you here without going to Chatti?"

The Pathan suddenly said, "Sir, let me tell you something when I am assured. We are the subjects of King Pratapaditya. His Majesty orders me and my brother that when you come to the mouth of Jessohar, you are killed on the way."

Vasant Roy was startled and said, "Ram Ram Ram."

Udayaditya said, "Go ahead."

send We have never done such a thing, so he threatened us in various ways to make us object. So I was forced to travel for this purpose. I met you on the way. My brother took your attendants crying saying that robbers have fallen in the village. I was burdened with this work. But, my lord, although it was the king's order, I was not at all inclined to do such a thing. For, says our poet, by the command of the king, by the command of the Lord, you can destroy the whole world. But be careful, don't destroy even a corner of heaven. Now the poor, took refuge in Maharaj. If I return to the country, I will be destroyed. If you don't save me, I have no choice." He said and stood with folded hands.

Vasant Roy stood surprised. After a while he said to Pathan, "I am giving you a letter to go to Raigarh. I will return there and do you a favor."

Udayaditya said, "Grandfather, will you go to Jessohar again?"

Vasant Roy said, "Yes brother."

Udayaditya was surprised and said, "What is he talking about?"

Vasant Roy. Pratap is no one else for me, let him commit a thousand crimes, he is my absolute love. I fear no harm to myself. I am brother, standing by the sea; A wave is all I need. But if I commit this sin, I can be at ease thinking about the loss of glory in this life and the hereafter. Hug him and explain everything once."

Tears came to Basant Ray's eyes. Udayaditya covered his eyes with both hands.

At that time Basant Roy's attendants came back to make noise.

"Where's your majesty? Where's your majesty?"

"I am here Bapu, where else will I go?"

Everyone said in unison, "Where is the boy?"

Vasant Roy was embarrassed and said, "Yes, yes, father, you don't say anything to Mr. Khan."

the first Today, my lord, I have suffered a lot, today he--

the second Don't stop; I say everything well done. He sent the boy straight along us and finally left-hand into a mango orchard--

the third No, that's Acacia forest.

Fourth. It's not left-handed, it's right-handed.

the second Far khepa, that is left-handed.

Fourth. Is it left-handed in your words?

the second If the left-hander does not happen, then the pond--

Udayaditya Yes Bapu, it feels left-handed, say it after that.

the second command yes That left-hander led through the sugarcane fields to a field. I passed many cultivated fields, swamps, bamboo groves, but I did not even smell the name of the village. After walking around for three hours, I could not find where the boy had escaped from near the village.

the first I can't stop seeing that bitch.

the second I also thought something like this would happen.

the third Every time I saw it, I was suspicious.

Finally everyone expressed that they understood everything beforehand.

# Chapter 5

Pratapaditya said, "Look minister, the two he sent have not arrived yet."

"It's not my fault, Your Majesty," the minister said slowly.

Pratapaditya got annoyed and said, "There is no question of guilt. There is a reason for the delay? What do you think, I am asking."

the minister Shimultali is far from here. There should be delay in going, completing work and coming back.

Pratapaditya was displeased with the minister's words. He wants, what he also guesses, the minister also guesses. But the minister did not go that way.

Pratapaditya said, "Did Udayaditya go out last night?"

the minister Ajna Yes, I have told you before.

Prominence I told you before! You told me at the right time! At what time do you know that your work is over? Udayaditya was not like that before. I think the daughter of the zamindar of Sreepur must have given him bad advice. What does it feel like?

the minister How can I say Maharaj?

Pratapaditya said, "Do you want me to listen to Vedavakya? Don't tell me what you think!"

the minister You hear all about the bridegroom Thakurani from the buffalo, you can guess about this, how can I guess?

A Pathan entered the house.

Pratapaditya said, "What happened? Have you finished the work?"

send Yes, Your Highness, it's gone by now.

Prominence What kind of talk is that? But you don't know?

send Ajna Yes, I know. The work was done, there is nothing wrong with that, but I was not present at the time.

Prominence But how did it work?

send As per your suggestion, I have separated his men and left, Hussain Khan has finished his work.

Prominence If not?

send My lord, I put my head on bail.

Prominence Well, be there. Your brother will be rewarded when he returns.

Pathan stood in charge of the guards near the far gate.

Pratapaditya remained silent for a long time and slowly said to the minister, "We have to try so that the people do not know about it."

The minister said, "Your majesty, do not be displeased if I say that it will be revealed."

Prominence How do you know?

the minister In the past you have openly expressed your hatred towards your parentage. You did not invite Basant Roy during your daughter's marriage, he himself came uninvited. Today you suddenly invited him for no reason and killed him on the way. In such a situation, the people will know you as the root of this incident.

Pratapaditya got angry and said, "I can't understand anything about you, Minister. You should be happy as soon as this word is revealed, let your conscience be filled with my condemnation. Otherwise, why are you saying day and night that the word will be revealed. I am not the reason for it to be revealed. I don't see it. I think, if the news doesn't become the state, you will go door to door and publish it yourself!"

The minister said, "Your Majesty, please forgive me. You understand everything much better than I do. It is too much of a challenge for a small-minded person like us to minister to you. But have you not kept me as a minister, daring to tell you what the small-minded think at times?" If you are angry with the ministry, then release this servant from this task."

Pratapaditya straightened up. Sometimes Pratapaditya was satisfied when the minister gave him a hard word or two.

Pratapaditya said, "I consider, if those two Pathans are killed, there will be no more reason to fear in this matter."

The minister said, "One murder is to be suppressed, it is impossible to handle three murders. The people will know." The minister always kept his word.

Pratapaditya said, "But I am full of fear! The subjects will know! Jessohar is not Raigad; here the subjects do not rule. Here all but the king are not the kings. So do not make me afraid of the subjects. If any of the subjects against me in this matter." If he speaks, I will burn his tongue with a hot iron."

The minister smiled to himself. He said to himself-- So much fear of the tongue of the people! However, the mind is taught that do not fear any people!

Prominence After completing Shraddhshanti, we have to go to Raigarh once with people. I do not see anyone else as the heir to the throne there.

Old Vasant Roy slowly entered the house-- Pratapaditya recoiled startled. Suddenly he thought, I understand the deity. He was surprised and could not say a word. Basant Roy went near and put his hands on him and said in a soft voice, "What am I afraid of Pratap? I am your father. Even if you don't believe that, I am old, I don't have the power to harm you."

Pratapaditya is conscious, but he is very inept at making up words. He stood there surprised without answering. It wasn't until he bowed down to his father.

Basant Roy again slowly said, "Pratap, say something. If Daibat has done something that makes you feel ashamed and embarrassed to see me, then don't think about it. I will not raise anything. Come, son, Let's hug each other once. It's been a long time since we met today; and we won't see each other for a long time."

After this time Pratapaditya bowed down and got up and cooed with his father. Meanwhile, the minister slowly left the house. Basant Roy smiled gently and put his hand on Pratapaditya's hand and said, "Basant Roy has been alive for a long time - hasn't Pratap? The time has come, God knows why he didn't call yet. But there is no more delay."

Basant Roy remained silent for a long time, Pratapaditya did not answer. Basant Roy said again, "But let me tell you everything clearly. You have cut me more than a knife by raising a knife. (Water came to his eyes as he said. ) But I am not angry at all. I only tell you two things. Kill me. Don't do it Pratap! It will not be good for you in this life and the hereafter. If you can wait for my death for so long, can't you do it for two days?

Vasant Roy saw that Pratapaditya did not answer. He did not deny guilt, or speak of repentance. Presently he went on, saying, "Pratap, go once to Raigad. You have not been there for a long time. You will see many changes. The soldiers have now laid aside their swords and taken up the plough; where the soldiers' lodgings used to be, the guesthouses--"

At that time, Pratapaditya saw from a distance that the pathan was trying to escape. Couldn't stay any longer. The unbridled anger that was bubbling up in the mind, became excited like a source of fire. He said in a loud voice, "Don't let the informer go. Hold him." Saying that, he hurried out of the house.

The king called the minister and said, "You are very careless in the kingdom."

The minister said slowly, "Your Highness, I have no fault in this matter."

Pratapaditya said in his voice, "Am I referring to something? I am saying that you are very inattentive to the kingdom. I left a letter with you that day, but you lost it."

A month and a half ago something like this happened, but then Maharaj did not say a word to the minister.

"And one day I ordered you to go to Umesh Roy, you send people and get things done. Keep quiet. Don't try to make excuses. Anyway, I told you, you don't pay any attention to royal affairs."

The king called the guards. Previously the night watchmen had been cut off their wages, now they were ordered to be imprisoned.

He went to Anthapura and called Mahishi and said, "Mahishi, I see great disorder in the royal family. Udayaditya was not like that before. Now he goes out every now and then. He joins the affairs of the subjects. He opposes us. What is the meaning of all this?"

Mahishi got scared and said, "Maharaj, there is nothing wrong with her. That bigo is the root of all these misfortunes. I was never like this before. I can't understand what happened to Uday from the day she got married in the house of Sripur."

Maharaj ordered to keep Surma under control and went out. Mahishi sent for Udayaditya. When Udayaditya came, he looked at his face and said, "Oh, my child has turned black. How was the child's color before marriage. Like hot gold. Who made you look like this? Father, don't listen to what your old wife tells you. Such has been the case." Surma was standing aside with the veil. Mahishi began to say, "He is born in a small family, is he worthy of you? Does he know how to advise you? I speak the right words and never gives you good advice, let him live if you are bad. Maharaja gave you marriage to such a demon." The buffalo started shedding tears.

Sweat spots appeared on Udayaditya's calm forehead. Lest the impatience of his mind should be revealed, for this purpose he turned his eyes to the other side.

An old old maid was sitting, she waved her hand and said, "The girls of Sripur know magic. They must have drugged the child." Saying this, he got up and went to Udayaditya and said, "Father, she has given you medicine. That girl you see, she is not a little girl. She is a girl from Sripur. She is a witch. She did not put anything else in the child's body." Saying this, he shot an arrow-like glance at Surma and rubbed his dry eyes with his hands and made them red. Seeing that, the buffalo's sorrow completely disappeared. Lately, the contagion of crying among the elderly became widespread. Everyone gathered in the queen's house with the intention of crying. Udayaditya Karunnetre once looked at Surma's face. Surma saw it through the veil and wiped her eyes and slowly went into the house without saying a word.

In the evening Mahishi said to Pratapaditya "Today I explained everything to Uday. My child is not like that. If you explain, he understands. Today his eyes have opened."

# Chapter 6

Seeing Biva's pale face, Surma couldn't stay any longer, held her throat and said, "Biva, why are you silent? Why don't you say whatever is on your mind?"

Viva said slowly, "What more can I say?"

Surma said, "You haven't seen him for a long time, what do you think! You don't write a letter asking him to come. I will make it easy for your grandfather to send it."

Biva's husband Chandradwipati Ramachandra Roy is being talked about.

Vivah began to walk and say, "If anyone here does not welcome him, if anyone does not consider it necessary to call him, then it is better if he does not come here. If he comes, I will prevent him. He is king, where he is not loved, there." Why should he come? Why is he less than us, that the father should insult him?" Bibha couldn't handle it any more, her face turned red and she started crying.

Surma put Viva's face on her chest and wiped her tears and said, "Well Viva, what would you do if you were a man? Don't you go to your in-laws' house saying that the invitation letter was not passed?"

Viva said, "No, I could not. If I were a man, I would have gone away at once; I would have thought nothing of the insult. But why would he come if I did not call him affectionately by saying that?"

Viva has never said so much. A lot has been said about emotions today. By now, I felt a little shy. I think I have talked too much. Again, as I have said, it is a big shame. Gradually the tension in his mind subsided and a heavy depression slowly began to press in his mind. Biva covered her face with her arms and lay down with her head on Surma's lap, Surma bowed her head and started parting her thick hair with soft hands. How long has it been? Neither of them said a word. Beaver is dripping water from her eyes one by one and Surma is wiping them slowly.

After a long time, when the evening came, Viva slowly sat up and wiped her tears and smiled. That smile means, "What a boy have I done today." He gradually turned his face away and tried to run away.

Surma held his hand without saying anything. Without raising anything else, he said, "Viva, have you heard, grandpa has come?"

Biva Grandfather has come?

Surma. yes

Biva Asked with interest, "When did you come?"

Surma. Around four o'clock.

Biva Have you come to see us yet?

Beaver's heart was full of pride. Viva is very cautious about taking possession of grandpa. In fact, one day Basant Ray had a long conversation with Udayaditya and made Vivah wait for three steps in the entrance, without going to see him even once, because of this Vivah was so distressed that even though he did not say anything about it, he could happily talk to Dadamahshay. no

Basant Roy entered the room and sang with a smile.

"It's been a long time since I saw you today.

fear not be happy

I will not stay longer.

I have come to Dudanderi.

I will see only the face

Listen to two sweet words

I will go to the country after seeing the smile from behind."

Vivah bowed her face and smiled after listening to the song. He is very happy. He is so excited that he is embarrassed to be caught.

Surma lifted Biva's face and said, "Grandpa, you didn't have to hide to see Biva's smile."

Vasant Roy. No, Viva thought, if not a smile at all, then a little smile. I quite understand the intention of the Dakini, the trick of chasing me. But it's not happening anytime soon. If I come, I will burn it well, I will remember it until I see you again."

Surma smiled and said, "Look, grandpa, Viva told me in my ear that if the intention is to remember, then what you have lit is enough, and there is no need to light it again."

Vasant Roy was very amused after hearing this. He started laughing.

Viva became apathetic, "No, I never said anything. I didn't say anything."

Surma said, "Grandfather, your wish has been fulfilled! If you wanted to see a smile, you saw it, if you wanted to hear a speech, I also heard it, but now go to the country."

Vasant Roy. No brother, I could not do that. I've brought fifteen songs and a full head of hair, can't leave without draining them all.

Viva couldn't stay any longer, laughed and said, "You don't have half a head of hair, Grandpa."

Dadamahshay's ambition was fulfilled. The first meeting after a long time required some arrangement to open the beaver's mouth, but once the beaver's mouth opened to grandpa, more arrangements were required to close it. But under no circumstances did Beaver open his mouth to anyone except Grandpa Mahashay.

He shook Basant Ray's hand and said, "He is gone one day, brother. On the day when Basant Ray had a head of hair, on that day, would I have walked all the way to please you? If I plucked one strand of hair, I would be willing to pluck five beautiful hairs like you and ten with the desire of my heart. Plucking out raw hair."

"Well grandpa, did you look better when you had a head of hair than you do now?" asked Viva in a serious tone.

Beaver had strange doubts about that. Grandfather's bald head, his broad smile without any connection, his old man's expression, he tried to change in his mind, but it didn't work at all. He saw that his grandfather was useless if he did not give the bald head. And adding a mustache makes Grandfather's face look bad. It gets so bad that he can't help but smile when he imagines it. Grandfather's mustache again! Grandfather is not bald again!

Basant Roy said, "There is a lot of difference of opinion on that. My granddaughters are fascinated by my baldness, they haven't seen my hair. My grandmothers are fascinated by my hair, but they haven't seen my baldness. Those who have seen both, are yet to make up their minds. Can't."

Viva said, "But that being said, grandpa, it won't look good if you lose more than your baldness."

Surma said, "Dadadamashaya, baldness will be discussed later. Now Biva, make a solution."

Biva quickly went to Vasant Roy and said, "Grandfather, I will lift your gray hair."

Surma. what do i say--

Biva Don't listen, grandpa, your--

Surma. Viva shut up. I say, once you go--

Biva Grandpa, you have nothing but mature hair on your head, if you remove it, all heads will be bald.

Vasant Roy. If you don't listen to me, sister, if you disturb me, I will talk raga hindol.

Balia began twisting the ears of his miniature sitar. Biva had a special hatred for Hindol Ragas.

Viva said, "What a disaster. But I run away." Balia went out of the house.

Then Surma became serious and said, "If you know the pain that Viva is carrying day and night in her soul, I think even the Maharaja feels pity!"

"Why. Why. What happened to him." Vasant Roy went to Surma with great interest and sat down.

Surma said, "One day in a year no one even remembers to invite Thakurjamai!"

Basant Roy thought and said "That's right."

Surma said, "How many girls can bear this disrespect for their husband? Viva is a good person, so she doesn't say anything to anyone, she cries secretly in your heart."

Vasant Roy was confused and said, "Do you cry secretly?"

Surma. How much I cried this afternoon.

Vasant Roy. Was Viva crying this afternoon?

Surma. yes

Vasant Roy. Ah, call him once, I see.

Surma caught Viva. Basant Roy held her chin and said, "Why are you crying, sister? Why don't you tell your grandpa what's bothering you? Then I'll do my best. I'll go now, tell Pratap."

Biva said, "Grandpa, fall on your two feet and don't tell my father anything about me. Grandpa, don't fall on your feet."

After a while, Basanta went out; He went to Pratapaditya and said, "You have not invited your son-in-law for a long time. This shows utter disregard for him. If you do not honor the son-in-law of Yashoharpati as much as he should, then it is an insult to you. There is nothing to be proud about."

Pratapaditya did not dispute the words of his father. It was ordered to send the invitation letter to Chandradwip along with the people.

Vasant Roy's sitar playing was blown away by coming to Biva Surma in Anthapura.

"Du-Nayan with a smile on a dirty face."

Viva said shyly, "Grandfather, have you told all my words to father?" Basant Roy began to sing,

"Smiling on dirty faces, twin eyes.

Leave the dirty seat, dear, put on the cover."

Viva put her hands on the strings of the sitar and closed the sitar and said again, "Have you spoken about me to my father?"

At that time, Udayaditya's eighth-year-old son, Samaditya, peeked into the room and said, "Oh, sister. You are talking to grandfather! I am coming to tell mother."

"S, S, Brother S." Saying Vasant Roy caught him.

The royal family believed that Vasant Ray and Surma had destroyed Udayaditya. For this purpose, when the spring judgment comes, Samal Samal falls. Samraditya started a struggle to get rid of Vasant Ray. Basant Ray gave him a sitar, put him on his shoulders, put on glasses, subdued him between two bars in such a way that he started to follow Dadamahshay back and forth all day and after playing the sitar, he tore the five strings of his sitar and cut off the mezrap and did not give it anymore.

# Chapter 7

King Ramachandra Roy of Chandradwip is sitting in his palace. The house is octagonal. A cloth-wrapped stick hangs from the rope. In one of the niches of the wall, there are images of Ganesha and the rest of Krishna in various states. They were created by the handiwork of the famous craftsman Batavrishna Kumbhkar. Sheets are spread all around, in the middle is a mattress made of shriveled fish, on which is a king and a taqiya. It has a lace fringe on its four corners. Hanging native mirrors around the wall, the face cannot be seen properly. Even with all the man-mirrors around the king, he can't see his face properly, his body looks too big. To the left of the king is a huge albola and the minister Harishankar. To the south of the king is Ramai Bhand and the bespectacled commander Fernandez.

The king said, "Oh Rama."

Ramai said, "Order, Your Majesty."

King laughed. The minister laughed more than the king. Fernandez clapped and laughed. Ramai's eyes twinkled with satisfaction. The king thinks, not laughing at Ramai's words reveals the sarcasm; The minister thinks that the king should smile when he succeeds; In Fernandez's view, of course, there is something to laugh about. Besides, when the unfortunate Rama opens his lips, Daibat does not smile, Rama leaves him crying. Few people laugh with delight at Nahile Ramai's Mandhata's peer jokes. But with fear and sense of duty everyone smiles, starting from the king to the gatekeeper.

The king asked, "What is the news, O?"

Rama thought a joke must be made.

"Traditionally it was heard that a thief had fallen into the house of the commander."

The commander became impatient. He understood that an old story was being tried on him. As he is afraid of Ramai's jokes, Ramai always squeezes him. The king's great pleasure. As soon as Rama arrived, he sent for Fernandez. There are two main pleasures in the king's life; Watching a sheep fight, and putting Fernandez in front of Ramay's face; Not a single bullet or arrow scratched the commander until he entered the kingdom. That person has come to tears after eating balls of laughter. Readers will be excused, we cannot record all the jokes of Ramai, most places have to be omitted at Suruchi's request.

King narrowed his eyes and asked, "After that?"

"I submit, my lord. (Fernandez unbuttoned his coat and began to put it on.) Thieves have been sneaking into the commander's house for three or four days at night. The Brahmin of the master came to know and pushed the master a lot, but could not wake the master."

the king Ha ha ha ha ha!

the minister Hoh Hoh Hoh Hoh Hoh Hoh.

commander Heh heh.

"During the day, not being able to bear the oppression of the housewife anymore, he said with folded hands, "Thank you, I will catch the thief tonight.' At two o'clock in the night the housewife said, "The thief has come." The teacher said, "That is the light that is burning in the house. The thief will run away if he sees us.' He called the thief and said, "Today you survived. There is light in the house, today you can escape safely, come tomorrow and see how you don't get caught in the dark."

the king Ha ha ha ha

the minister Ho ho ho ho ho.

commander hee

The king said, "After that?"

Rama saw that the king was still not satisfied. "I don't know why the thief wasn't scared enough. He came home the next night too. Ginny said, "Get up, damn it.' "Don't you get up," said the master. "What am I going to do when I get up," said Ginny. 'Why, don't you light a light in the house,' said the master. 'I can't see anything.' Ginny was very angry. Karta became even more angry and said, "Look, everything has gone because of you. Turn on the light and bring the gun.' In the meantime, the thief finished his work and said, "Sir, can you give me a piece of tobacco? It has been a lot of work." Karta Bisham scolded and said, "Rose son! I am arranging the tobacco. But if you come to me, I will blow your head off with this gun.' After eating tobacco, the thief said, "Sir, if you light the light, it would be useful. The stick has fallen and I cannot find it." The commander said, "Beta is afraid. Stay away, don't come close.' He quickly turned on the light. The thief slowly tied up the things and left. The boss said to Ginny, "Beta Bisham is scared." "

The king and the minister cannot contain their laughter. Fernandez continued to let out a few "heh heh" giggles.

The king said, "Ramai, have you heard that I am going to my father-in-law's house?"

Rama made a face and said, "Asarang khalu samsarang sarang swashurmandirang (Laughter. First the king, then the minister, then the general.) It is not a lie. (sighing) All the sar in the sharsurmandir is the food, the samadar; the milk is available, the fish wrap is available. Goes; all are dung matter; only that most vain wife."

The king laughed, "What is he, your half--"

Ramai said anxiously, "Maharaj, don't call him half-hearted. If I do penance for three births, I have hope that one day I will be his half-hand. Even if I add five half-hands like me, his size will not be reduced." (Laughter respectively.) Everyone understood the meaning of the words, not only the minister could not, but the minister had to laugh the most for this reason.

The king said, "I have heard that your brahmin is very calm and very good at homemaking."

Ramai What is the meaning of that word? There are all sorts of messes in the house, only I can't stand it. In the morning, the housewife shook her head so much that she fell at the door of the king.

Here we introduce Ramayi's Brahmani in context. He is very emaciated and getting weaker day by day. When Rama comes home, he does not know where he will take shelter. In the Raj Sabha, Rama shows his teeth in one way and when he comes home, he shows his teeth in another way to the housewife. But if you describe the real nature of the housewife, or if the humor does not come, the pity comes, for this purpose, Rama describes his housewife as fat and fierce, the king and the ministers cannot stop laughing.

When the laughter stopped, the king said, "Oh Rama, you have to go, I will take the commander with you."

The commander understood that this time Ramai would attack him a second time. He lifted the glasses to his eyes and began to unbutton them and put them on.

Ramai said, "The Commander-in-Chief can have no objection to going to the festival site, because this is no longer a war zone."

The king and the minister thought that a very funny thing was coming; He asked with interest, "Why?"

Ramai Saheb's eyes are covered with glasses day and night. Wear glasses and listen while sleeping, otherwise you can't dream well. The commander has no objection to going to war, except lest the cannonballs hit the glass of the spectacles and break the glass and tear the eyes, this is the fear. How are you sir?

The commander narrowed his eyes and said, "It's not what it is." He got up from the seat and said, "Maharaj, if you order, I will leave."

The king told the commander to prepare for the journey, "Make all efforts for the journey so that my sixty-four-mast boat is ready." The minister and the commander left.

The king said, "Ramai, you have heard everything. Last time I was badly beaten by my in-laws."

Ramai Ajna Yes, Maharaj's lungul was made.

The king smiled, his mouth flashed, but the darkest clouds formed in his mind. He is not very pleased to hear that Rama has come to know this news. And if anyone knew, it wouldn't have hurt as much. He continued to pull the gurguri.

Ramai said, "One of your brothers-in-law came and said to me, "The tail of your king has been revealed in the house; He is Ramachandra, or Ramdas? I didn't know that before.' I immediately said, "How do you know before? It was not before. He has come to your house to get married, so he has adopted all manners in the land of heaven." "

The king was very happy to hear the answer. He thought that his and his ancestors' faces brightened from Rama and Pratapaditya's Aditya became completely eternal. The king did not owe much to war. He magnifies all these small incidents like war crimes. Until now he had thought that he had suffered a most humiliating defeat. Day and night he remembered this disgrace and he used to ask the world to hesitate in shame. Today his mind was much comforted that the general had come victorious in Ramai Ran. But still the burden of shame did not completely go away from his mind.

The king said to Ramai, "Ramai, now you have to go and win. If you win, I will give you my ring."

Ramai said, "Maharaj, what is Jay's idea? If you can take Ramai to Anthapura, then I can even make my mother-in-law Thakurani drink ghol to her heart's content."

The king said, "His thoughts? I will take you to the heart of the city."

Ramai said, "What is impossible for you?"

The king also believes the same. What can he not do? If one of the devotees says, "Victory to the King, fulfill the desire of the servant." His Highness Ramachandra Ray immediately said, "Yes, that will be." Let no one think that there are things which cannot be done by him. He decided to take Ramai Bhand to Pratapaditya's inner city, to make fun of the buffalo-mother himself, but his name is Raja Ramachandra Raya. If he could not do such a great work, then what king is he?

Chandradwipadhipati sent for Rammohan Mal. Rammohan Mal was like Bhima in prowess. The body is about four and a half cubits long. Muscles are wavy all over the body. He is a man of the reign of the heavenly king. Ramachandra has been nurtured since childhood. Everyone is afraid of Ramai, if Ramai is afraid of anyone, it is Rammohan. Rammohan hated Ramai very much. How Rama automatically shrank at the sight of his hatred. If he could avoid Rammohan's gaze, he would not leave. Rammohan came and stood. The king said, fifty attendants will go with him. Rammohan will become their leader.

Rammohan said, "That order. Will Ramai Thakur go?" Ramai Tagore's cat-eyed squint narrowed.

# Chapter 8

Today the employees are very busy at Jessohar Rajbati. The son-in-law will come, various initiatives have to be taken. Elaborate arrangements are being made for them. Mahishi had no disagreement with Pratapaditya about the fact that the dynasty of Chandradwip was inferior to that of Jessohar, yet today he is very happy that his son-in-law will come. Since morning, he has started decorating Viva with his own hands - Viva is in a strange mess. Because, the young couple with the elderly mother have different tastes about the method of decorating; But what happens, what makes a beaver good, buffaloes understand it well. Beaver had an idea in her heart that if she wore three thin turquoise colored bangles, her white little hands would look two times bigger; Mahishi was so delighted to see her wearing eight thick gold bangles and one big diamond bracelet that he sent for all the old maids and widows in the house to show it to everyone. Biva knew that the nath would not fit her little Sukumar's face at all--but Mahishi proudly inspected her by putting a large nath on her face, turning it once to the right and once to the left. Viva remained silent on this too, but the way Mahishi tied her hair became unbearable for her. She secretly went to Surma and tied her hair to her heart's content. But it could not escape the gaze of the buffalo. Mahishi saw that all of Beaver's clothes were soiled just because of tying her hair. He could clearly see that Surma had messed up Biva's hair tie out of jealousy. Beaver tried to open his eyes to Surma's nefarious intentions. After waiting for a long time, when he decided that the work was done, he untied her hair and tied it again. In this way, Vivah is completely embarrassed carrying the burden of her hair, her nose, her two arms full of bangles, her one heart full of joy. He has come to understand that he can't keep the intense pleasure in his heart, it just flashes like lightning in his eyes. He felt that even the walls of the house were trying to mock him. Prince Udayaditya came and saw Biva's smiling face with deep loving calm joy. He was so happy to see Beaver Harsha that he went home and kissed Surma with a gentle smile.

Surma asked, "What?"

"Nothing," said Udayaditya.

At that time Vasant Roy forcibly dragged Viva and brought her inside the room. Grabbing her chin, she raised her face and said, "Look, grandfather, look at your wife's face today. Surma, and Surma, take a look." The old man laughed with joy. Beaver looked at his face and said, "If you're happy, don't laugh, brother, I'll see."

How can I hold on to my feet with a smile?

He plays the life-long and elusive game of laughter.

If I hadn't gotten old, I would have read your face and died. Alas, Moriba is old. I used to die in my youth. There is no death unless there is disease in old age."

Pratapaditya was asked by his brother-in-law, "Who has gone to receive the son-in-law Babaji?" "What do I know," he said. "Today on the way must be given light?" His eyes widened and Maharaj said, "Of course you have to pay, there is no such thing." Then the prince hesitated and said, "Why don't you sit down?" "There is no leisure to think about all those things." The truth is, bringing home a son-in-law by playing the instrument is not an act of virtue.

Ramachandra Ray's great pride has appeared. He determined that he had been deliberately insulted. Previously, people were sent from Rajbati to Chakdihi to receive him twice or once, this time after crossing Chakdihi and coming two crores later, Dewanji has come to receive him at Bamanhati. Even if Dewanji came, two hundred and fifty book people did not come with him. Why, didn't fifty more people meet in all of Jessohar? According to Ramai Bhand, the elephant that has come to take the king is bigger than the fat Dewanji. Ramai asked Dewan, "Sir, Ooty is your youngest?" Dewanji, the good man, was astonished and replied, "No, it is an elephant."

The king got angry and said to the dewan, "The elephant that your minister is riding is also bigger than this one."

The Diwan said, "The big elephants have been sent away on royal occasions, and there is not one in the city."

Ramachandra decided that they had been sent away to insult him. If not, what else can be the reason!

Rajadhiraj Ramachandra Ray got angry and took his father-in-law's name and said, "How am I younger than Pratapaditya Ray?"

Ramai Bhand said, "Age and relationship, if not what else? That's why you married his daughter--"

Rammohan Mal was standing nearby, he couldn't stand it anymore, Bisham got angry and said "Look, Tagore, you have grown big. Don't talk like that about my mother Thakur. I said this clearly."

Aiming at Pratapaditya, Ramai said, "I have seen Aditya like that. You know, my lord, the person who can hold Aditya in his arms is the servant of Ramachandra."

The king tilted his face and started laughing. Rammohan then slowly came in front of the king and said, "Maharaj, that dwarf who says whatever he wants in the name of your father-in-law, I can't bear it. So let's close his mouth."

The king said, "Rammohan, you stop."

Then Rammohan went away from there.

On that day Ramachandra reviewed thousands of details and decided that Pratapaditya had made elaborate arrangements for a long time to insult him. He is full of pride. He has decided to hold such a statue for Pratapaditya, so that Pratapaditya can understand how great a man his son-in-law is.

When Pratapaditya met Ramachandra Raya, Pratapaditya was sitting in the royal chamber with his minister. As soon as Ramachandra saw Pratapaditya, he slowly bowed down and bowed to him.

Pratapaditya calmly said, "Come, how are you?"

Ramachandra said softly, "Ajna yes."

Looking at the minister, Pratapaditya said, "Have you investigated the complaint that came in the name of Tehsildar of Bhangamathy Pargana?"

The minister took out a long paper and handed it to the king, the king began to read. Kiaddar raised his eyes once and asked his son-in-law, "Like last year, you didn't get a flood there this time?"

Ramachandra. do not command Water increase once in the month of Ashwin--

Prominence A copy of this letter has been kept by the Minister.

Baliya started reading again. After reading, he said to his son-in-law, "Go, Bapu, go to Anthapura."

Ramachandra got up slowly. He has understood what is greater than him.

# Chapter 9

When Rammohan Mal came to Anthapura and bowed to Viva and said "Mother, I have come to see you once", Viva felt great joy. He loved Rammohan very much. Rammohan used to come to Jessohar from Chandradwip almost every now and then, carrying various duties of the family. Even if there was no necessity, he would come to see Viva once in a while when he got free time. Rammohan was not ashamed of Viva at all. When old, strong, tall Rammohan came and stood up saying "Mother", there was such a pure, simple, unadorned affection in him that Viva would think you were a mere girl to him. Viva said to him, "Mohan, why didn't you come so long?"

Rammohan said, "That mother, "If you are a bad son, you are never a mother-in-law', who did you think of me? I said to myself, "I won't go if mother doesn't call me, let's see how long she remembers." Where is it, I did not remember even once."

Viva got into a lot of trouble. He could not tell why he did not call. Apart from that, saying that he did not think that he did not call, it seems that there is a flaw in the logic somewhere in this saying, but he is not able to explain it well.

Seeing Beaver's difficulty, Rammohan laughed and said, "No, mother, I couldn't come because I didn't get free time."

Viva said, "Mohan, you are old; tell me your story."

Rammohan sat down. Chandradwip began to be described. Biva put her hand on her cheek and started to listen. Hearing the description of Chandradwip, how many imaginations arose in his heart, how many houses he had built on the sky that day had no place. When Rammohan told the story of how his house had been washed away in the flood of the last monsoon, how he had swum alone to the top of the temple on the eve of the evening with his old mother on his back and the two of them had spent the whole night there, what a heartbeat appeared in Beaver's small chest.

After telling the story, Rammohan said, "Mother, I have brought four conch shells for you, you will have to wear them on that hand, I will see."

Biva untied her gold bangle and put on the conch and smilingly went to her mother and said, "Mom, Mohan has untied your bangle and made me wear the conch."

Mahishi smiled and said without being displeased, "It is quite arranged, it is quite arranged."

Rammohan became very excited and proud. Mahishi called him and took him, being present himself, fed him. After he had eaten to his heart's content, he was very pleased and said, "Mohan, this time sing the song of your arrival." Rammohan looked at Biva and said,

"I don't see you all year, mother, how are you doing to me,

I lost my eyes and became blind.

Eli ki Pashani Ore

I will see you with my eyes full

Nothing stops that mother, the stream of burning eyes."

Rammohan's eyes were filled with tears, Mahishi also looked at Biva's face and wiped his tears. He remembered his victory in the song of Agari.

Gradually evening came. Crowds of old ladies flocked to the house. Neighboring women gathered in Anthappur to see the son-in-law and mock the son-in-law according to the relationship. Joy, shame, apprehension, in an uncertain unpredictable don't-know-what-will-happen way, Viva's heart is racing, her face and ears are red, her hands and feet are getting cold. Who knows the happiness of this pain!

Son-in-law has come to Anthapura. Like a flock of thorned beauties, the ladies attacked him from all sides. Laughter erupted all around. From all around came the sharp mockery of cuckoo-voices, the harsh thrusting of Mrinal-arms, the sharp torture of the moon-claws of Champak-fingers. When Ramachandra Ray was completely upset, an old woman came and sat by his side. He began to speak in such a harsh voice and gradually all kinds of idiosyncrasies came out of his mouth that the old women's mouths became closed. Didi, who was near his face, also became silent. Bimaladidi got up from the room and left. Only Bhuto's mother had told him one thing. When the said ghost's mother's mouth was moving, the old woman said to her, "My mother, it is not your face, but a bunch of weeds." Bhuto's mother immediately said, "And Magi, your face is sticky, even though I scrubbed it so much, it did not clear." He said and went away. One by one the house emptied, Ramchandra Ray got a break.

Then the old man came out of the house and came to the room of the buffalo. There the buffalo used to feed the slaves. Rammohan also sat on one side and ate. The old man came to the buffalo and inspected it and said, "This is Niksha Janani." As soon as Rammohan heard it, he was startled and looked at Praudha's face. Immediately he gave up his food and jumped like Shardul, holding both his hands in thunderous fists and saying in a thunderous voice, "I know you Thakur." Saying that, he uncovered his head cloth. None other than Ramai Tagore. Rammohan trembled with anger, took off the sheet from the bed; With both hands, he lifted Rama into the sky, saying, "Today I have your death in my hands." Saying that, he turned it two times in the sky. The buffalo ran and said, "Rammohan, what are you doing?" Ramai said in a bitter voice, "Please father, don't commit Brahmin." A strange commotion arose from all around. Then Rammohan lowered Ramai to the ground and trembled and said, "Wretched, didn't you have a place to die?"

Ramai said, "Maharaj has ordered me." Rammohan said, "What did you say, Nimkaharam? If you say such words again, I will rub your face on this Shan stone." Said and held his throat.

Rama cried out. Then Ram Mohan tied Rama with a sheet and hung it like a sack and went out of Anthapura.

Little by little, it has become a state. It was already two o'clock in the night. The king's brother-in-law came that night and informed Pratapaditya that his son-in-law Ramai Bhand had taken her to Anthapura as a wife. There he mocked the Puraramanis and even the buffaloes.

Then the image of Pratapaditya became very scary. His whole body was stirred with rage. Spitzta got up from the bed like a lion and sat down. Said, "Call Lachman Sardar." Lachman said to the Sardar, "Tonight I want to see the dismembered face of Ramchandra Roy." He immediately saluted and said, "Yo Hukum Maharaj." At once his brother-in-law fell at his feet, saying, "My lord, have mercy, remember Biva once. Do not do such a thing." Pratapaditya reasserted, "I want Ramachandra Ray's head by tonight." His brother-in-law clasped his feet and said, "Maharaj, today they have slept in Anthapura, have mercy, have mercy, have mercy." Then Pratapaditya remained silent for a while and said, "Lachman, listen, tomorrow morning when Ramachandra Raya comes out of Anthapura, you are ordered to kill him." The brother-in-law saw that he had gone much further than he thought. He crept that night and knocked on Beaver's bedroom door.

The two o'clock chimes are ringing in the distance. In the silent night, there is no sound of Nahabat with Jyotsna, with the south wind, creating dreams in sleeping souls. The light of Jyotsna penetrated the open air of Beaver's bedroom and fell on the bed, Ramchandra Roy was engrossed in sleep. Viva sits up and thinks silently with her hand on her cheek. Looking at Jyotsna, two drops of tears were falling from his eyes. I understand that it did not happen exactly as I had imagined. He was crying in his soul. The day you have been waiting for has come today.

Ramachandra Ray did not have a word with Beaver until he had gone to bed. Pratapaditya has insulted him -- how can he insult Pratapaditya? No, ignoring the divorce. He wants to know, "You are the daughter of Pratapaditya of Jessohara, do you dress next to Chandradwipadhipati Raja Ramachandra Raya?" With this determination, he who lies on his back and does not change his side. All the honor and shame is for Biva. Biva sits awake and thinks. Once she looks at Jyotsna, once at her husband's face. Her chest trembles and heaves a long sigh-- of life. There was a great pain in him. Suddenly Ramchandra woke up. Suddenly he saw that Biva was sitting quietly and crying. When the memory of humiliation did not wake up in the first moment of that sleeping state, after deep sleep the soundness of mind returned, the feeling of anger went away, then suddenly Biva Seeing that pitiful little face filled with tears, compassion immediately arose in his heart. He held Viva's hand and said, "Viva, are you crying?" Viva became anxious. Viva could not speak, Viva could not see, Viva lay down. Then Ramchandra Ray sat up and sat down. Slowly took Biva's head and placed it on his lap, wiped away her tears. At that moment who knocked on the door. Ramachandra said, "Who is he?" The answer came from outside, "Open the door immediately."

# Chapter 10

Ramachandra Roy opened the bedroom door and came out. "Father, run away now, don't delay a moment," said the prince Ramapati.

Hearing this suddenly that night, Ramachandra Ray was startled, his face turned white, he asked with bated breath, "Why, why, what has happened?"

"I won't tell you what happened, run now."

Viva left the bed and asked, "Mama, what's wrong?"

Ramapati said, "It's no use listening to you, mother."

Beaver cried out. He once thought of Vasant Roy, once of Udayaditya. He said, "Mama, tell me what happened."

Ramapati did not give any answer to his words and said to Ramachandra, "Father, there is a useless delay. Look for a way to escape secretly this time."

Suddenly, a very sinister apprehension arose in Beaver's mind. Gamanodyat blocked Matul's way and said, "I fell on your two feet, tell me what happened."

Ramapati looked around the assembly and said, "Gol karis ne viva chup kar, I am telling everything."

When Ramapati told them all one by one, Viva began to scream and get up. Ramapati quickly pressed his face and said, "Hush, hush, do not destroy." Biva sat there with breathless voice.

Ramachandra Roy said in awe, "What can I do now? What is the way to escape, I don't know anything."

Ramapati said, "The guards are on alert all around tonight. I'll take a look around to see if there's any way out."

Saying this he started to leave. Viva caught her and said, "Mama, where are you going. You don't go, you stay with us."

Ramapati said, "Viva, you are mad. It will not do you any good to stay close. Until then, let me take a look around."

Viva then forcibly stood up. Hands and feet are trembling. Said, "Mama, you stay here a little longer. I'll go to Dada." Balia Biva hurried to Udayaditya's bedroom and appeared.

Then the faint moon sets. It is getting dark all around. No response anywhere. Ramchandra Roy stood at the door of his bedroom and saw the doors of the classified rooms of the Raj-Antahpur closed on both sides, all sleeping undisturbed. The front yard is overshadowed by the surrounding foundation and a little jyotsna still remains on one side of it. Gradually that too got mixed up. Darkness took over the whole world one step at a time. Darkness came and sat down among the classified coconut trees of the garden. Darkness came very close to the lap and stood. Ramachandra Roy began to imagine that a knife was waiting for him somewhere in the surrounding darkness. South or left, forward or backward? The one corner that is being seen hesitantly, isn't someone sitting in a corner with a frown, covered with a blanket? What if there is someone in the house? Under the bed, or on one side of the wall. His whole body trembled, sweat began to fall from his forehead. Once thought if uncle does something, if he has any penchant? He slowly stood up. A wind came and the lamp in the room went out. Ramachandra thought, who knows who extinguished the lamp - who knows who is in the house. Ramapati approached and called, "Mama." Mama said, "What daddy?" Ramachandra Roy said to himself, it would be better if Viva stayed near, uncle is not having good faith.

Viva fell down in tears near Udayaditya, her mouth was speechless. Surma sat her up and asked, "What's wrong, Viva?" Viva held Surma in both hands and could not say a word. Udayaditya lovingly put his hand on Viva's head and said, "Why Viva, what has happened?" Biva held her brother's hands and said, "Dada, come with me, you will hear everything."

The three of them went to Milia Beaver's bedroom door. There in the darkness Ramachandra is sitting and Ramapati is standing. Udayaditya hurriedly asked, "Uncle, what happened?" Ramapati said everything one by one. Udayaditya looked at Surma with wide-eyed eyes and said, "I'll go to father now--I won't let him do that. No way."

Surma said, "Would that be of any use? Rather than that, send grandpa to him once, if he sees any benefit."

"Well," said the prince.

Vasant Roy was sleeping deeply. When he woke up, he saw Udayaditya and thought that it was morning. At once Loli began to sing a song,

"Flowers withered in the grave, Canaan flowers bloomed in the forest,

The light of day is manifest, the mind is in the mind."

Udayaditya said, "Grandfather, there is danger."

Immediately Vasant Roy's song stopped. He got up in panic and came to Udayaditya and asked hurriedly, "Ah. What is it, grandfather? What has happened. What is the danger."

Udayaditya said all. Vasant Roy sat on the bed. Looking at Udayaditya's face, he shook his head and said, "No, grandfather, does this ever happen? Is this ever possible?"

Udayaditya said, "No more time, go to father."

Basant Roy got up, walked, repeatedly asked, "Dada, does this ever happen? Is this ever possible?"

Upon entering Pratapaditya's house, he asked, "Father Pratap, is this ever possible?" Pratapaditya has not yet gone to the bedroom--he is sitting in his mantra. For a moment it seemed that Lachman would call Sardar back. But that resolve was instantly lost. Pratapaditya ever ordered twice? The mouth that gave the order to take the order back? It is not his job to play with orders. But Viva? Biva will be a widow. Even if Ramachandra Ray had voluntarily jumped into the fire, Viva would have been a widow. Ramachandra Ray willingly jumped into Pratapaditya Ray's wrath, the inevitable result of which was that Bibha would become a widow. What is Pratapaditya's hand in this? But he didn't think that much. Sometimes when all the events are vividly dawning in his mind, he becomes very impatient, wondering, when will the night fall? Just then the old Vasant Roy entered the house busy and eagerly held Pratapaditya's hands and said, "Father Pratap, is this ever possible?"

Pratapaditya got up and said, "Why is it not possible?"

Vasant Ray said, "Boy, unfaithful, is he worthy of your wrath?"

Pratapaditya said, "Boy! If you put your hand in the fire, your hand gets burnt, he is not old enough to understand this! Boy! A foolish brahmin without Lakshmi, who shows his teeth to fools and earns by eating, has dressed him as a woman and brought him to mock my buffalo, "What can be the result of so much intelligence that can be provided, he has not provided the intelligence in his head. Sadness is, when the intelligence is provided in the head, then his head will not be in his body." The more he tried to say, the more his body began to tremble, the more his vow became stronger, the more his impatience grew.

Vasant Roy shook his head and said, "Ah, he is a boy. He does not understand anything."

Pratapaditya became unbearable, he said, "Look, Pitrubyathakure, if you have the knowledge of what insults the Ray dynasty in Jessohar, then can you tie the title of the Mughal king on that long hair. He has bowed down. You are wearing the soil of your youth on your forehead. You were about to bury the dusty head of your youth in the dust, but the irony of the gods prevented it. You are the one who has come today to beg for forgiveness for the insulter of the Ray dynasty."

Basant Roy then said slowly, "Pratap, I understand that when you raise the knife once, it wants to fall on one person. I moved away from his target and another person became his target. Good Pratap, if you have mercy in your mind." If not, if your hungry anger wants to devour a man, let me do it. Here is the head of your hoof (said Basant Roy bowing his head). Take it if it pleases you. Bring the knife. This head has no hair, this mouth. There is no form of youth. Yama has sent the invitation, and the proper decorations for that meeting are finished. (A very faint smile appeared on Basant Ray's face.) But think, Pratap, Vivah is our milk-daughter, when her two eyes shed tears--" Boti Boti Boti Basant Ray cried in impatient excitement, "Finish me, Pratap. I am not happy to be alive. Finish me before I see tears in his eyes."

Pratapaditya was silent for so long. When Basant Roy finished speaking, he slowly got up and left. He understood that the word had been revealed. He went down and called the guards and ordered that the canal adjacent to the royal palace should be closed immediately with large wooden planks. Ramchandra Roy's boat is in that canal. He specially warned the guards that no one should come out of Anthapura tonight.

# Chapter 11

When Vasant Roy came back to Anthapura, Viva broke down in tears on seeing him. Basant Roy could not hold back his tears anymore, he held Udayaditya's hand and said, "Dada, you find a way for this." Ramachandra Roy became very impatient. Then Udayaditya took his sword in his hand, "Come with me." Everyone went at once. Udayaditya said, "Biva, you stay here, you don't come." Viva did not listen. Ramachandra Roy also said, "No, let Vivah come at once." In that silent night, everyone started walking. It seemed that horror was extending its invisible hand from all around. Ramachandra Roy began to look sideways at the front. Doubts started to arise towards uncle. Udayaditya came to the gate after crossing Anthapura and found the gate closed. Viva said in a horrified voice, "Dada, the door to go down may not have been closed. Go there." Everyone went in that direction. He went down the long dark stairs. Ramchandra Roy thought, no one can climb down these stairs, I understand that the hole of Vasuki-snake is here, this is the staircase to go down to the underworld. He went up the stairs and found the door closed. Again everyone got up slowly. All the exits from Anthapura are closed. They all met and wandered from door to door, returning to each door two or three times. All are closed.

When Viva saw that there was no way out, she wiped away her tears. He took her husband's hand and took her to his bedroom. He stood firmly near the door and said in a calm voice, "I will see who can take you out of this house. Wherever you go, I will go before you, I will see who prevents me." Udayaditya stood near the door and said, "No one can enter the house without killing me." Surma stood beside her husband without saying anything. Old Vasant Roy stood in front of everyone. Mama left slowly. But Ramchandra Roy did not like this settlement at all. He thinks, "What can Pratapaditya do not do. I do not believe that Bibha and Udayaditya will be able to do anything. If you can somehow get out of this house, live."

After a while, Surma said softly to Udayaditya, "If we stand here, it does not seem that any result will come, on the contrary. The more the father is hindered, the stronger will be his resolve. Make a way to escape from the palace tonight somehow."

Udayaditya worriedly looked at Surma's face for a while and said, "But I will go, I will see by force."

Surma nodded firmly in agreement, "Go."

Udayaditya threw down his northern seat and walked away. Surma immediately went some distance. He went to a secluded place and embraced Udayaditya's chest. Udayaditya bowed his head and gave her a long kiss and left in a moment. Then Surma came to his bedroom. Tears began to fall from his eyes. Jorahaste said, "Mago, if I am Patibrata Sati, save my husband now from his father's hand. He whom I have sent away to-day in this peril, it is only on you, mother. If you destroy me, who else on earth will you?" Don't believe it." He cried every now and then. Surma sat in that darkness and called "ma" "ma" many times in her mind, but it seemed as if mother could not hear her. The wreath that he gave to his feet in his mind seemed as if he did not take it, it fell from his feet. Surma cried, "Why mother, what have I done?" I could not hear his answer. He saw in the surrounding darkness, the image of the deluge danced. Surma started looking around blankly. He could not sit alone in the house anymore. Beaver went out and came home.

Vasant Roy said in a sad voice, "Dada has not returned yet, what will happen?"

Surma leaned against the wall and said, "What God does."

Ramachandra Roy was then bent on destroying his old servant Rammohan. Why not, because of that all these dangers happened. He used to punish him as much as possible. Sometimes there is a realization that there will be no more time to punish.

Udayaditya, sword in hand, crossed the entrance, went to the barred door, and stomped on it - said, "Who are you?"

The reply came from outside, "Ajna, I am Sitaram."

"Open the door quickly," said the prince firmly.

He immediately opened the door. When Udayaditya started to leave, he said with folded hands, "Yuvaraj, take care, there is no order for anyone to come out of Anthapura tonight."

Yuvraj said, "Sitaram, will you also take up arms against me? Well then come." Said the Aussie extracted.

Sitaram said with folded hands, "No Yuvraj, I cannot take up arms against you, you have saved my life twice." Balia took the dust of his feet on his head.

Yuvraj said, "But what do you want to do quickly, there is no time."

Sitaram said, "The life which you have saved twice, do not destroy it now. Disarm me. This sword is my weapon. Tie me upside down. Otherwise I will not be safe from the king."

Yuvraj took her arms, tied her with her clothes. He was lying there, he left. Some distance away there is like a high wall. There is only one door in that wall, that door is also closed. Only after crossing that door can you go outside the inner city. The prince leaped over the wall without hitting the door. He saw a guard leaning against the wall and sleeping peacefully. He got down very carefully. In a flash of lightning, he fell upon the sleeping guard. He cut off his weapon and threw it away and tied the head of the stunned guard. He had a key, took that key and opened the door. Then the guard woke up, said in a surprised voice, "Yuvaraj, what are you doing?"

Yuvraj said, "I am opening the door of the inner city."

The watchman said, "Tomorrow what shall I reply to your Majesty?"

Udayaditya said, "Tell me, Yuvraj has defeated us by force and opened the gate of Anthapura. Then I will be freed."

Udayaditya came out of Anthapura and went to the house where the people of the son-in-law were staying. Only Rammohan and Ramai Bhand were sleeping in that room, and everyone else had eaten and gone to the boat. Yuvraj, slowly touched Rammohan. He jumped up startled. Surprised and said, "What is this? Prince?" "Come out," said the Prince. Rammohan came out. Yuvraj told everything to Rammohan.

Then Rammohan tied a cloth on his head and waved a stick, inflamed with anger and said, "Let's see how big Lachman Sardar's people are. Yuvraj, bring our maharaja to me just once. I can divide a hundred people with this stick alone."

Yuvraj said, "I accept that, but there are more than a hundred people in Jessohar's palace. You cannot do anything by force. You will have to find another way."

Rammohan said, "Well, bring the king to me once, if he stands by my side I can think of a way with peace of mind." Then Udayaditya went to Anthapura and called Ramachandra. He and all with him came.

Ramachandra saw Rammohan and was overwhelmed with anger and said, "I let you go now, go away. You are an old man, what more can I punish you. If I survive this journey, I will never see your face again." Ramachandra's voice became hoarse. He loved Rammohan rightly, Rammohan has been taking care of him since childhood.

Rammohan raised his hand and said, "Who are you to take me away, my lord? God has given me this job. The day Yama calls me, God will take away this job from me. You don't keep me, I am your servant." Saying that he stood facing Ramachandra.

Udayaditya said, "Rammohan, what are you doing?" Rammohan said, "This stick is the way with your blessings. And the feet of Maa Kali are the trust."

Udayaditya shook his head and said, "That way is of no use. Well, Rammohan, which way is your boat?"

"In the canal on the south side of the palace," said Rammohan.

"Let's go to the roof," said Udayaditya.

Rammohan suddenly thought of a way -- he said, "Yes, that's right, let's go there."

Everyone went up to the roof of the palace. The roof is about seventy cubits below the canal. Ramachandra's sixty-four-masted boat floats in that canal. Rammohan said, Ramchandra Roy would be tied on his back and he would jump there.

Basant Roy hurriedly grabbed Rammohan and said, "No, no, what's wrong with him? Rammohan, don't do such an impossible thing."

Biva was startled and said, "No Mohan, what are you talking about?"

Ramachandra said, "No Rammohan, that will not happen."

Then Udayaditya went to Anthapura and collected some very thick large sheets. Rammohan cooked them and tied them into a huge rope. A rope was tied to a small pillar on the roof of the side where the boat was. The rope ends just above the boat. Rammohan said to Ramchandra Ray, "Maharaj, you hold my back, I will fall down with a rope." Ramachandra necessarily agreed to it. Then Rammohan bowed to all one by one and took the dust of all, saying, "Jai Maa Kali." He lifted Ramachandra on his back, Ramachandra closed his eyes and gripped his back passionately. Looking at Biva, Rammohan said, "Mother, I am on my way. Don't be afraid of your child."

Ram Mohan gripped the rope. Biva leaned on the pillar and stood vigorously. Old Vasant Roy stood on trembling legs and closed his eyes chanting "Durga" "Durga". Rammohan climbed down the rope and went to the end of the rope. Then he let go of his hand and bit the rope with his teeth, and holding Ramchandra with both hands, he lowered him into the boat very carefully and jumped in himself. Ramachandra fainted as soon as he got into the boat. As Ramachandra got into the boat, Vivah took a deep and long breath and fainted. Vasant Roy narrowed his eyes and asked, "Dada, what happened?" Udayaditya lovingly embraced the fainting Viva and went to Anthapura. Surma held Udayaditya's hand and said, "What will happen to you now?" "For me I do not think," said Udayaditya.

Meanwhile, the boat went some distance and got stuck. Big big shawl wood canal! At that time, the guards saw from a distance that the boat ran away. He started pelting stones, but not a single one reached. The guards had swords, not guns. A man went to fetch a gun. After searching, the gun was paired but the flint was not paired. Rammohan and his attendants pulled the boat on the wood and took it away, saying "Ore barud kyar--guli kyar". The guards went to call a boat to follow. On the way, on whom the burden of calling the boat fell, Hari ate a piece of tobacco in a grocer's shop and raised Ram Shankar from his bed and went to get the money he owed quickly. When the need for the boat was absolutely furail, the boat came screeching. Seeing the delay, everyone began to scold the boat-caller at length. He said, "I am no longer a horse." One by one, when everyone finished reprimanding, they realized that there was no chance of catching the boat. The delay in bringing the boat was three times the delay in reprimanding. As Ramachandra's boat reached the Bhairav River, Fernandez fired a cannon. Pratapaditya had fallen asleep in the morning. The sound of that cannon woke up immediately. He called out, "Watchman." No one came. The gatekeepers fled that night. Pratapaditya called out in a loud voice, "Watchman."

# Chapter 12

Pratapaditya woke up and called loudly, "Watchman." When the watchman did not come, he immediately left the bed and stormed out of the room. called, "Minister." A servant ran and immediately called the minister to the inner city.

"Minister, where did the guards go?"

"The guards at the gate have fled," said the minister. The minister saw danger looming overhead. For this reason Pratapaditya answered clearly and quickly. The more he hesitates and delays in answering his words, the more he gets fired up.

Pratapaditya said, "The guards of Antapur?"

The minister said, "When I arrived, I saw that they were handcuffed."

The minister knew nothing about the night. Can't guess what happened. But he understood that something worse had happened. At that time it is impossible to ask Maharaj anything.

Pratapaditya hurriedly said, "Where is Ramachandra Ray? Where is Udayaditya? Where is Basant Ray?"

"I think they're in the middle of nowhere," the minister said slowly.

Pratapaditya got annoyed and said, "I could have felt it. I asked you what to do. What is felt is not always true."

The minister slowly went out without saying anything. All the events of the night were informed to Ramapati. When he heard that Ramchandra Roy had run away, he had a special thought. The minister went out and saw that Ramai was sitting in a shriveled state. Seeing the minister, Ramai Bhand said, "This is minister Jambuban." Balia bared her teeth. His toothy smile was called a joke by Ramchandra's audience, not horror. After listening to his salutation, the minister said nothing, did not look at him. "Bring him," said one of the servants. The minister thought, let's put this mischief in front of Pratapaditya's wrath this time. The thunderbolt of Pratapaditya will fall on one person or another - let it fall on this banana tree, the rest of the big trees will be protected.

Seeing Rama, Pratapaditya got really excited. Especially when he bared his teeth and made gestures to tell a joke to please Pratapaditya, Pratapaditya could not bear it anymore. He immediately left his seat and, waving his hands, exclaimed in great disgust, "Take it away, take it away, take it away now. Who said to bring it before me?" If hatred had not arisen with Pratapaditya's anger, then Ramai Bhand would not have survived the journey. Because even if you want to beat a hateful person, you have to touch it. Ramai was expelled immediately.

The minister said, "Your majesty, the princess--"

Pratapaditya nodded impatiently, "Ramachandra Ray—"

"Yes, he left Rajpuri last night," said the minister.

Pratapaditya stood up and said, "Abandoned! Where have the guards gone?"

"The guards at the gate have fled," repeated the minister.

Pratapaditya clenched his fists and said, "They have fled? Where will they flee? They must be found wherever they are. Call the guards at Anthapura immediately and bring them." The minister went out.

It was still dark when Ramachandra Roy boarded the boat. Udayaditya, Vasant Roy, Surma and Viva came that night and did not go to bed. Vivah lay down without saying a word, without shedding a single tear, Surma sat near her and started stroking her head. Udayaditya and Basant Roy sat in silence. Each other's faces are seen vaguely in the dark room. As if an invisible person - say dark, say apprehensive, blind - is sitting in the room, the sound of his breathing is heard. The happy-hearted Vasant Roy, seeing the beauty around him, is absolutely heartbroken. He is constantly shaking his hand, looking around, and thinking - what happened. His noise is blocked, he is not able to master the surrounding matters well. The whole incident seems to be a complicated nightmare for him. Once in a while Vasant Roy held Udayaditya's hand and said in a bitter voice, "Dada." Udayaditya said, "What grandfather?" Vasant Roy did not answer him. Within that one "Dada" address, a yearning disoriented heart's wordless thousand unspoken questions are crouching for expression. He has no particular question, all his words mean-- what is this? The surrounding darkness is talking to his ears in such a noisy manner that he cannot understand anything. At such a time, when he got Udayaditya's response, his mind was a little settled. While standing there, he held Udayaditya's hand and said, "Dada, did all this happen for me?" He repeatedly thinks that all this has happened because he could not destroy him. Udayaditya did not feel like talking more. "No grandpa," he said softly. The house was silent for a long time. Vasant Roy said again, "Biva, my sister, why didn't you speak?" Balia Basant Roy went to Biva and sat down. After a while Vasant Roy spoke again, "Surma, oh Surma." Surma looked up and said nothing. The old man sat down and began to shake his head. He was waiting for an unpredictable danger. Surma then sat still and rubbed her hand on Biva's forehead, but Antaryami could see what was happening in Surma's heart. Surma looked at Udayaditya's face once in that darkness. Then Udayaditya kept his head on the wall and what was he thinking. Surma's eyes began to shed tears. He wiped it off slowly, lest Viva find out.

Vasant Roy breathed his last when it became light all around. Then an unpredictable fear disappeared from his mind. Then he discussed all the events with determination. He left Beaver's house. He went to Sitaram handcuffed at the gate of Anthapura. He said to him, "See Sitaram, when Pratap asks you, who has tied you up, you say my name. Pratap knows that Vasant Ray was once strong, he will believe you."

What Sitaram would reply to Pratapaditya, he was thinking that after waiting so long. Udayaditya's name did not bother him at all. He once decided to convict a crooked-legged three-eyed palm-shaped ghost, but found Basant Roy and acquitted the innocent ghost. He immediately agreed to Vasant Roy's words. Then he went to the second guard and said, "Bhagwat, if Pratap asks, tell him that Basant Ray has tied you." Soon Bhagavata's religious knowledge became very strong, absolute hatred for untruth was born; The main reason was that he was very angry with Udayaditya.

Bhagwat said, "Do not order me to do that, it would be my adharma."

Basant Roy put his hand on his shoulder and said, "Bhagavat, listen to me; there is no wrongdoing in this. If there is wrongdoing in telling a lie to save the life of a saint, why should I ask you like this?" Basant Roy put his hand on his shoulder and tried to make him understand again and again that there is no adharma in this. But when a man's religious knowledge suddenly becomes very strong, then no logic will work for him. He said, "No, my lord, how can I lie to my master?"

Vasant Roy Bisham became restless. He said anxiously, "Bhagavat, listen to me, let me tell you, there is no sin in this lie. Look, Bapu, I will make you very happy later, you keep my word. Take what I have, I have given you."

Bhagwat immediately raised his hand and the money was instantly sheltered in his tank. Vasant Roy went back feeling relieved.

Guards have been called to Pratapaditya. The minister took them with him. Pratapaditya then restrained his exuberant anger and sat solemnly. Pronouncing each word slowly and clearly, he said, "How did the door of Anthapura open last night?"

Sitaram's soul trembled, he said with folded hands, "My lord, there is no fault in me."

Maharaj frowned and said, "Who is asking you that?"

Sitaram hastily said, "No command, I say, Your Majesty, Yuvraj-- Yuvraj had forcibly bound me and left the palace." How suddenly the prince's name came out of his mouth. He was thinking more than anything about that name, that name appeared in front of his face in the noise for this purpose. Once out there is no escape.

At that time Vasant Roy heard that the guards were called. He went to Pratapaditya's room busy. Then Sitaram said, "I forbade the prince, he did not listen."

Basanta Ray quickly said, "Yes, yes, Sitaram, what did you say? Don't commit adharma, Sitaram, God will be pleased with you. Udayaditya has no fault in this."

Sitaram quickly said, "No, Yuvraj has no fault."

Pratapaditya said firmly, "But your fault?"

"No order," said Sitaram.

"But whose fault is it?"

"Command Your Highness--"

When Bhagwat was questioned, he told everything correctly, except that he had fallen asleep. Old Vasant Roy looked around and saw no way out. He closed his eyes and said "Durga" "Durga" in his mind. The guards were immediately dismissed. Their crime is that if they can be tied by force, then why have they come to guard? They were ordered to be flogged for this crime.

Then Pratapaditya looked at Vasant Ray's face and said in a thunderous tone, "Udayaditya has no pardon for this crime!" He said as if Udayaditya's crime was Vasant Ray's. It is as if he is reprimanding Udayaditya in front of him. Vasant Roy's crime, he loves Udayaditya more than his life.

Vasant Roy quickly said, "Father Pratap, Uday has no fault in this."

Pratapaditya got angry and said, "No fault? I will punish him specially because you say no fault. Why have you come to intervene and settle?"

Basant Ray took Udayaditya's side so much that Pratapaditya's mind became a special opponent of Udayaditya. Vasantha Roy saw it to give him peace lest Udayaditya be punished. He sat quietly and began to think.

After a while, Pratapaditya calmed down and said, "If only I had known that Udayaditya had some strength of his own mind, that he had an opinion, an intention, that he does everything by himself, if I had not known that he could blow the fool away at will, with sarcasm. If he could turn and kill at the signal, there was no escape for him today. Where I saw that feather flying, I looked down to see who was blowing it. For this, Udayaditya does not want to be punished. He is not worthy of punishment. But listen, Pitrivyathakur, if you come to Jessohar a second time. Meet Udayaditya and save his life."

Vasant Roy sat silent for a long time; Then he slowly got up and said, "Good Pratap, but I left this evening." Without saying another word, Vasant Rai left the room, went out and took a deep breath.

Pratapaditya has decided that those who love Udayaditya, those who are subordinate to Udayaditya, should be separated from Udayaditya. He told the minister, "The wife will not be allowed to stay in Rajpuri any more, she will have to be sent to her father's house." There is no fear of being a victim of Biva; Be that as it may, she is the girl of the house.

# Chapter 13

Basant Roy came to Udayaditya's house and said, "Dada, I will not see you again." Balia held Udayaditya in both hands.

Udayaditya held Vasant Ray's hand and said, "Why, grandfather?"

Basant Roy said it all. He cried and said, "Brother, you are so sad because I love you. If you are happy, I will spend these few days in the same way."

Udayaditya shook his head and said, "No, that will never happen. You will see me in you. No one can stop that. If you go, grandfather, I will not survive."

Basant Roy was upset and said, "Pratap didn't kill me, he took you away from me. Grandfather, when I go away, don't come back to me, you think Basant Roy is dead.

Udayaditya went to Surma in the bedroom. Vasant Roy went to Biva and held Biva's chin and said, "Biva, my sister, get up. Put that hand on the old man's head." Viva sat up and took Grandfather's head and began to lift his curly hair.

Udayaditya told Surma everything and said, "Surma, there seems to be a conspiracy to take away what I have left on earth." He held Surma's hand and said, "Surma, what if someone takes you away from me?"

Surma firmly embraced Udayaditya and said firmly, "He can do yoga, no one else can."

A similar fear has been brewing in Surma's mind for a long time. As if he could see, a hard hand was moving to take his Udayadity away from him. He hugged Udayaditya passionately, saying to himself, "I will not leave, no one can leave me."

Surma said again, "I have been thinking for a long time that no one can take me away from you."

Surma said that again and again. He wants to gather strength in his mind, that he will hold Udayaditya with two arms so that no earthly force can separate them. Repeatedly speaking that word, he is binding his mind like a ball of thunder.

Udayaditya looked at Surma's face and breathed, "Surma, I will never see grandfather again."

Surma sighed.

Udayaditya said, "I do not think of my own suffering, Surama, but of that which will play in the soul of Dadamahashaya. Let us see what else the Lord does. What else he has in store."

How many stories did Udayaditya Vasant Roy tell?

He began to remember what Basant Roy had said, what he had done in Samuda. Vasant Ray's pitiful heart, how many small deeds, how many small words, stored in the treasure of his memory like small jewels, today he began to reveal to Surma one by one.

Surma said, "Oh, what other people are there like grandpa."

Surma and Udayaditya went to Biva's house.

Then Vivah was picking up her grandfather's gray hair, and he was sitting and singing,

"Hey, gotta go, it's not too late,

How Rabi falls behind, all your companions are gone.

Come on, Bhav's game is over, it's dark.

(Ore) Go back again and again, who do you want to drink, brother?

Come to play, new people, new games,

Get out of here, or else you'll be beaten.

Put down the burden of life, and go straight to another country,

(There) I will build a new house, I will play a new game in that place."

Seeing Udayaditya, Basant Ray smiled and said, "Look, brother, Viva does not want to leave me. I do not know what she needs me for. Why does Viva want to dissolve the milk that was once there, has become old and curdled? Cry! You ever heard that? I can't watch a beaver cry, brother." He began to say,

"It's time for me to go,

Why do you hold me

With tears in his eyes

Bandhis ne and Mayadore.

The holiday of life is over,

Turn your eyes back,

Call me by name and call me brother,

Must go quickly."

"Look at that, look at that, look at Viva. Look Viva, if you cry like that--" Vasant Roy was speechless. He went to discipline Bibha and could not contain himself, quickly wiped his tears and said with a smile, "Dada, look at that brother, Surma is crying. Stop it this time; otherwise I will remain true and true, occupying your place. Those two hands I will pick up my hair, whisper into that ear through the broken teeth, and if any mishap happens near that ear, I will not be responsible for it."

Basant Roy saw that no one said anything, then he got upset and took out his sitar and started playing it at a strange speed. But on seeing Biva's tears, his playing of the sitar began to be greatly disturbed, his eyes began to blur at times, at times he felt the urge to speak in a rush, scolding Biva and everyone present, but he could not speak anymore, his voice stopped, the sitar stopped. Had to take it down. Finally it was time to say goodbye.

After hugging Udayaditya for a long time, he said the last words, "Dada, I have left this sitar, I will not play the sitar anymore. Be happy, Surma bhai. Biva--" He did not finish speaking, wiped his tears and got on the palanquin.

# Chapter 14

Mangala's cottage was at one end of Jessohar. He used to chant mala while sitting there. At that time Matangini, the maid of the palace, came with a bowl of vegetables.

Matang said, "I came to the market today, I thought, I haven't seen Mangala Didi for a long time, I will come to see her. I have a lot of work to do today, brother, I won't be able to stay long." Saying that, he sat there calmly, keeping his clothes on. "That sister, you know everything, that month loved me very much, well still lives, but I sensed that another person's mind has gone after him-- can't you make it so that the magician dies in three nights?"

Mangala has a remedy for all kinds of accidents, from losing a cow to losing a husband, besides she knows how to subjugate the big servants of the Rajbaati, how many ganda ganda tumbles in Mangala's cottage. If the magician dies within three nights, Matangini lives, she is none other than Mangala herself.

Mangala smiled to herself and said, "He is not too quick to die for the Magi, he will die if he increases the work of Yama." Mangala laughed openly and said, "Is there any other person who would like to throw away Rupsi like you? Granddaughter, you don't care. You will get his mind back. There is medicine in your eyes, apply a little more and see if it doesn't work. Feed him this root with water." Balia brought a dry root.

Mangala asked Matangini, "Say what about Rajbati?"

Matangini turned her hands and said, "What is our work with all those words, brother?"

Mangala said, "Right. Right."

Matangini did not expect that Mangala would have such a unity of opinion on this issue. He said a little blankly, "There is nothing wrong with telling you. But I don't have much time today, I will tell you everything one day." Balia sat down.

Mangala said, "That's enough, another day will be heard."

Matangini became impatient and said, "But I'm going, brother. How much more will I have to scold for saying I'm late. Look, brother, the king's son-in-law came to us that day, but he left without telling anyone the same day he came."

Mangala said, "Is it true? Why do you tell me? So I say, no one can give me the inside information unless it is Matang."

Matanga cheered up and said, "What do you know? Our wife Thakur can't see anyone well with two eyes. What mantras does she know, she has kept Swami like a sheep, she-- no brother, no work, who where? Diya will listen and say that Matang is talking about the Rajbari outside.

Mangala couldn't handle the curiosity anymore; Although he knew that if he remained silent for a while, Matanga would tell you everything, he could not bear the delay, said, "There is no one here, granddaughter. And talk among yourselves, what is wrong with this? What did your wife Thakrun do?"

"What did he do to the son-in-law in the name of our sister-in-law, so the son-in-law abandoned her overnight. Sister-in-law Thakrun is crying. Maharaja is angry, he wants to send wife-Thakrun to her father's house in Sreepur. Look, brother. , laugh at all your words. What is there to laugh at?

Every servant in the palace was well aware of the exact reason for Ramachandra Ray's escape, but no one was in agreement with anyone.

Mangala said, "Tell your mother-thakrun that there is no use in sending the wife-thakrun to her father's house soon. Mangala can give such a medicine that the prince's mind will completely go away from him." Saying that, he started laughing. Matanga said, "That's quite the story."

Mangala asked, "Does the prince love your wife Thakur?"

"What's the use of those words. You can't live without seeing a bar. You only come when you call the prince "Tu'."

"Well I'll give the medicine. Does the Prince stay with him during the day?"

"Yes."

Mangala said, "What will happen to the mother? Have you seen what she said to Yuvraj?"

"No brother, I didn't see it."

"You can take me to the palace once, I will come and see it once."

Matanga said, "Why, brother, why do you have such a headache?"

Mangala said, "That's not what I said. Once I see it, I will understand what spell he has subdued, whether my spell will work or not."

Matanga said, "That's enough, come today." Balia left with Chubri.

When Matanga left, Mangala began to bloom. He gritted his teeth, widened his eyes, and began to cry.

# Chapter 15

Basant Roy left. It was evening. Viva went on the roof of the palace. Seen from the roof, the palanquin has gone. Vasant Roy took his head out of the palanquin and turned his face once to look back. In the darkness of the evening, through the tears, the unchanging, stony-hearted Rajbati could see the long, hard walls of the palace dimly. The palanquin left, but Viva remained standing there. Wanted water on the way. The stars rose, the lamps burned, there were no people in the way. Vivah stood and asked silently. Surma looked for him all over the country and found him nowhere, finally he went to the roof and appeared. Beaver held his neck and said in a loving tone, "What are you seeing, Beaver?" Viva breathed and said, "Who knows brother." All life looks empty, there is no happiness in his life. He cannot find the reason why he goes into the house, why he comes out of the house, why he lies down, why he gets up, why he wanders around the house for two hours in the middle of the day. It is as if his house has gone away from the palace, as if he has no home in the palace. A sadh's house was built for him in Rajbati in a single day, where many games, joys and sorrows were mixed with laughter and tears from childhood. This house is not his house anymore. He is now homeless within the home. His grandfather was gone; When will people come to take Bibha from Chandradwip? Maybe Rammohan Mal has left, they don't know where yet. Beaver still has some happiness left. He has such a grandfather, he has the beauty of his life, but about them too, it is as if some danger is returning behind like a shadow. Does the house feel like a house anymore, where a deep mystery is smoldering invisibly through the walls of the house?

Udayaditya heard that Sitaram was in distress after being fired. He does not own a single penny, he has many planets attached to him. Because when he was getting a big salary from the royal house, his anger soon left all the royal work due to the excess of love and fell in love with his lovers. After arranging the meeting, she burst out laughing and said that seeing Sitaram, her hunger and thirst were all gone. There is a lot of evidence about the removal of hunger and thirst, but there is no evidence that only seeing Sitaram is the cause. A widowed sister of Sitaram's distant relation used to take the initiative to send one of her sons to work, at such a time she was always aware that if the child is employed in small work, the child's uncle is insulted. Understanding this, he could not do anything to protect the dignity of the child's uncle. In this way he saved his honor and made Sitaram indebted and arranged for your life in return. On it Sitaram has a widowed mother and an unmarried girl daughter. On the other hand, the Sitaram man is very fond, he cannot function without entertainment. Sitaram's condition has changed, but nothing incidental has happened with him. The hunger and thirst of his pizza has remained exactly the same; As her niece grew older, she became more and more aware of her distended belly and uncle's humiliation. Apart from Sitaram's money bag, no one's belly shows any sign of collapse. Sitaram's hobby is also maintained with other planets, it is increasing on edge, interest is also being nourished to the extent that it is also being nourished. Udayaditya heard about Sitaram's poverty and fixed monthly stipends for him and Bhagwat. Sitaram was very ashamed after receiving the money. By mentioning Udayaditya's name to the Maharaja, he has become an utter criminal to himself and to Udayaditya. She cried after receiving Udayaditya's money. One day, meeting Yuvraj, he tied his feet and addressed him as God, Jagadishwar, benevolent and begged for forgiveness profusely. Bhagavata man is very cold natured. He gambles, eats tobacco and distributes the lands of heaven and hell to his neighbors. When he received Udayaditya's money, he bowed his face and expressed in various expressions what revenge he would have for the money that Yuvraj had destroyed him. He had no objection to taking the money.

Pratapaditya heard that Yuvaraj was giving monthly stipends to the dismissed guards. It would not have happened before. Earlier he used to neglect Udayaditya so much that all talk about Udayaditya did not reach his ears. The king knew that Udayaditya mingled with the subjects, and on many occasions took the side of the subjects and opposed him, but they came to him almost so little and so infrequently that unless something special happened, Udayaditya's existence could not have attracted his attention. This time he paid a little special attention to Udayaditya, so the above incident immediately reached his ears. Pratapaditya was very angry after hearing this. He summoned Udayaditya and said, "Did I dismiss Sitaram and Bhagwat simply because the exchequer did not have enough money to pay their salaries? But because you yourself fixed their monthly stipends?"

Udayaditya slowly said, "I am guilty. You have punished me by punishing them. I am punishing them month by month according to your judgment."

Never before had Pratapaditya had to listen to Udayaditya attentively. Pratapaditya did not find Udayaditya's slow, solemn, humble tone and his well-balanced words at all. Without answering Udayaditya's words, Pratapaditya said, "I order, Udaya, that in future they should not be given any further financial assistance."

Udayaditya said, "A more severe punishment was decreed for me." He folded his hands and said, "But what crime have I committed, for which I have to bear such a great punishment? How can I see that eight or nine hungry mouths have not been fed for me, eight or nine unfortunates are helpless and crying on the road, while at my feet Is there no shortage of food? Father, everything I have is yours. You give me more food than I need, but if you put eight or nine hungry people in front of me during my meal, but prevent them from putting food in their mouths, then that food is not enough. That's my poison."

Pratapaditya did not interrupt the excited Udayaditya while he was speaking, and when he had finished speaking, he said slowly, "I have heard what you said, I will say what I have to say. I have stopped the studies of Bhagavata and Sitaram, and if someone determines their studies gives, but he shall be deemed contrary to my will." Pratapaditya's heart was filled with a little anger. Perhaps he himself could not understand the reason, but the reason was "I have done a great cruelty, so the body of kindness Udayaditya came to remedy it. Let me see what he can kindly do. Where I am cruel, whoever will be kind, so great." Whose life is Aspardha!'

Udayaditya went to Surma and told everything. Surma said, "She could not eat anything that day. In the evening, Sitaram's mother took Sitaram's little girl and came to me crying. I gave her something in the evening, but her whole family could eat. Sitaram's daughter was a milkmaid, she did not eat anything all day. What can be looked at in the mouth. Where will they go if they are not given something?"

Udayaditya said, "Especially when they are chased away from the palace, no one else will dare to give them work or help them because of the fear of the father. If we also turn away at this time, then they will have no one left in the world. I will help, think for him. No, Surma, but it is not good to displease the useless father, so that this matter can be resolved, he has to find a way."

Surma held Udayaditya's hand and said, "You don't have to do anything else, I will do everything. Put the burden on me." Surma wants to cover Udayaditya by giving herself. This year has been a bad year for Udayaditya. All that the blind man incites him to do is against his father; But they are such acts that a wife like Surma cannot prevent her husband from doing them. Surma is not such a wife. When Swami goes on a crusade, Surma ties his armour, then goes home and weeps. Surma's soul is haunted by fear at every step, but she trusts Udayaditya at every step. Udayaditya Ghor looked at Surma's face during the crisis, saw tears in Surma's eyes, but Surma's hands did not shake, Surma's steps were unwavering.

Surma arranged to send the scholarship to Sitaram's mother and Bhagwat's wife through the hand of one of her trusted maids. Dasi is faithful, but she does not consider it necessary to keep this a secret from Mangala. No one outside was aware of this except Mangala.

# Chapter 16

When Pratapaditya heard about sending the scholarship secretly, he sent an order to Anthapura without saying a word that Surma should go to Pitralaya. Udayaditya tied a strong ball on his chest. Biva cried and hugged Surma's neck and said, "If you go, what will I do in this crematorium?" Surma held Biva's chin, kissed Biva's face and said, "Why should I go Biva, my everything is here." When Surma heard Pratapaditya's order, he said, "I do not see any reason to go to Pitralaya. No one has come to take me from there, and my husband also does not agree on this matter. Therefore, I do not see any need to go immediately to Pitralaya without reason." Hearing this Pratapaditya got burnt. But he thought, there is no way. Surma cannot be forced out of the house, no physical force is used inside. Pratapaditya was very clumsy about girls, he knew how to use force on force, but he never thought of how to manipulate these girls. He can pull and tear the big toads but he can't open the fine glands with his fat fingers. These girls, according to him, are absolutely horrible and unfit to be known. Whenever a goal was struck about them, he quickly charged the buffalo. He has no leisure, no desire, and no ability to think about them. This is a very inappropriate thing for him to do. This time too, Pratapaditya called the buffalo and said, "Send Surma to his father's house." Mahishi said, "Then what will happen to Baba Uday?" Pratapaditya got annoyed and said, "Udaya is no longer a boy, I want to send Surma away from Rajpuri at the request of the king, this is my order."

Mahishi called Udayaditya and said, "Father Uday, let's send Surma to father's house." Udayaditya said, "Why mother, what crime has Surma committed?"

Mahishi said, "What do you know, son, we are girls, we don't understand anything, the Maharaja knows what opportunities will arise in the kingdom of the Maharaja by sending the wife to her father's house."

Udayaditya said, "Mother, what is the progress of the kingdom by making me suffer by making me suffer? I have endured so far as suffering is concerned, what happiness is left for me? Not the great happiness that Surma is in. For two evenings she has endured reprimands, "away ashes' that limb. - Covered, finally did not buy a place for him in the palace! Does he have anything to do with you, mother? Is he a beggar guest who keeps when he likes, chases when he likes? Then mother, there is no place for me in the palace, send me away too."

Mahishi started crying and said, "What do you know, father? I don't understand what the Maharaja does. But let me tell you, my wife is not a very good girl either. There is no peace here until she enters the royal palace. The bones were irritated. Let's see whether he goes to his father's house for a day or not. What do you say, boy! We will see if he leaves here for a day or not.

Udayaditya did not make any further reply to these words, sat in silence for a while, then got up and left.

Mahishi cried and went to Pratapaditya, "Save the king. If you send Surma, Udaya will not survive. There is no fault of the child, what spell has that witch put on him?" Saying this, the buffalo wept and yearned.

Pratapaditya Bisham got angry and said, "If Surma does not go, I will keep Udayaditya imprisoned."

Mahishi came from the Maharaja and went to Surma and said, "Poramukhi, what have you done to my child? Give me back my child. Have you not destroyed me till Asya? Finally--will you not be satisfied without that king's son giving him a fetter in his hand?" ?"

Surma got up and said, "Will you handcuff him for me? What is he talking about? I'm going now."

Surma went to Biva and told everything. Biva held her throat and said, "Biva, I left, and I don't think I will be allowed to come back here." Viva cried and hugged Surma. Surma sat there. A word came from the infinite end of the eternal future and began to beg in his soul, "It will not happen again." I will not be able to come, and there will be nothing! Such an empty future stretched out in front of him,--a future that has no face, no smile, no love, no eye-to-eye, chest-to-chest, soul-to-soul, no exchange of joy and sorrow, even if the chest is torn open, there is not even a drop of love, no affection, Nothing, what a terrible future. Surma's chest heaved, his head began to spin, tears dried up. As soon as Udayaditya came, Surma clasped her legs and pressed her chest and burst into tears. Surma never cried like that. His strong heart is broken today. Udayaditya took Surma's head in his lap and asked, "What happened Surma?" What else can Surma say looking at Udayaditya's face? Looking at the face and crying. Said, "I will not see that face? It will be evening, you will come and sit in the bed, I am not next to you? Light the lamp in the house, you will come and stand near that door, and I will not hold your hand with a smile? When you are here, I will then Where?" Surma said "where", how much despair in it, how far away separation! How far away when only eye to eye can meet! When even that cannot be, how much further! When the message is delayed, how much longer! When even if it is a mortal desire, we will not see each other even for a moment, then--then, holding those two legs and pressing them to the chest, it is happiness to die right now.

# Chapter 17

Rukmini is mentioned in the beginning of the anecdote, I think the readers have not forgotten it. This Mangala is that Rukmini. He left Raigarh and changed his name to live on the outskirts of Jessohar. There is nothing extraordinary about Rukmini. She is sensual, jealous, greedy for power and power, like a common low-natured woman. Hasikanna holds his hand, pulls it out if necessary, holds it up if necessary. When he is angry, he is very fierce, as if he would tear the container of anger with his nails. Then he did not speak more, the fire started coming out of his eyes, he trembled and trembled, and the anger started to boil in the corner of his heart like molten iron. Jealousy was bubbling up like a snake in his mind and began to lash out. Meanwhile, he takes various vows, performs various tantric ceremonies. He can understand the minds of the class of people with whom he mingles wonderfully. When Yuvraj sat on the throne, he would sit on the throne of Yuvraj's heart and rule his heart-kingdom and Jessohar-kingdom together. What can he not do for this. After many days and continuous efforts, he thought with all the servants of the royal palace. He kept up to date every little news of the palace. He also heard when Surma's face became dirty, Pratapaditya's slight pain reached his ears, as if this time Apada would die. He has performed various rituals for the death of Pratapaditya and Surma, but nothing has succeeded yet. Every morning he wakes up thinking that today he might hear that Pratapaditya or Surma is lying in bed and dying. Every day his impatience is increasing. I think let's put the mantra tantra in the oven, once I have it at hand, it will satisfy my heart. Bhabhi kept on biting in such a way that it was about to bleed.

Rukmini saw that every day the king's and the royal buffalo's animosity towards Surma increased. Finally it went so far that it was proposed to send Surma away from the palace. There is no limit to his joy. When he saw that Surma still didn't go, he resorted to an easy way to send him away.

When Raja Mahishi heard that a widow named Mangala knew various kinds of Tantra Mantra medicine, then he thought that it would be better to win the heart of the Prince before sending Surma away from the palace. Matangini was sent to fetch medicine secretly from Mangala.

Mangala took various roots, soaked them all night, mixed them, chanted mantras and started preparing the poison.

In that quiet late night, in the sheltered cottage on the edge of the deserted city, Hamandista's voice began to rise, that voice became his only companion, that tireless monotonous voice began to clap to the rhythm of his dancing enthusiasm, his enthusiasm began to dance twice, his eyes no longer slept.

It took five days to prepare the medicine. The poison does not require five days to prepare. But at the time of Surma's death it took a long time to recite mantras and perform ceremonies so that the Yuvraj would not feel mercy.

Like Pratapaditya, Laiya Mahishi allowed Surma to stay in the royal palace for a few more days. Surma will go away, Viva is looking around. He has been sitting by Surma continuously for several days. Like a dirty shadow that goes silent and returns with Surma. Day by day passes, evening comes, Viva wants to hug Surma more closely and hold her. It is as if someone is tearing the days away from their lively attraction. Darkness surrounds the beaver. Everything is empty in Surma's eyes. He no longer has north, south, east, west, all the geography of the world is mixed. She lies at Udayaditya's feet, lying on his lap, silently desiring the water in his mouth, doing nothing else. Saying to Viva, "Viva, I left everything to you", covering her face with both hands and crying.

The afternoon has come; Tomorrow is Surma's farewell day. Everything in his household was handed over to Viva one by one. Udayaditya sits calmly and resolutely. He has decided that either he will keep Surma in Rajpuri or he will also leave. When evening came, Surma could no longer stand, her legs began to tremble, her head began to spin. He went to the bedroom and lay down, saying, "Biva, Viva, call him once and don't delay!"

As Udayaditya approached the door, Surma said, "Come, come, how is my soul doing?" He said and raised his arms. As Udayaditya approached, he clasped her legs together. Udayaditya sat down, Surma was breathing heavily, her hands and feet were cold. Udayaditya was frightened and called out, "Surma." Surma raised her head very slowly and looked at Udayaditya's mouth and said, "What Nath." Udayaditya was confused and said, "What happened Surma?" "I think my time has come," said Surma. Udayaditya's voice said, He wanted to raise his hand to embrace, but his hand did not rise. He only looked at the face. Udayaditya held Surma's face with both hands and said, "Surma, Surma, where are you going Surma. Who else is left with me?" Surma's eyes began to water. He just stared at Beaver's face. Biva is then unconscious and looking at Surma with unconscious eyes. In front of where Surma and Udayaditya used to sit every evening, that space is open. The stars in the sky are visible, the wind is blowing slowly, the surroundings are still. The lamps were lit in the house, the conch-bells of worship in the Rajbati stopped gradually. Surma said softly to Udayaditya, "Say something, I can't see well."

Gradually it became known in the palace that Surma was dying by consuming poison with her own hands. The buffalo came running, everyone came running. Seeing Surma's face, Mahishi cried and said, "Surma, my mother, you stay here, you don't have to go anywhere. You are the Lakshmi of our house, who told you to go?" Surma took the dust of her mother-in-law's feet on her head. The buffalo cried twice and said, "Mother, are you angry?" Then Surma's voice was choked, what to say, did not come out. When the night is four o'clock, the doctor says "It's over!" Saying "Dada, what's going on?" Viva fell on Surma's chest and hugged Surma. It was morning, Udayaditya was sitting with Surma's head in his lap.

# Chapter 18

Surma is no more? Beaver does not think that why? As if Surma can be seen, as if Surma is there! Biva wanders from house to house, her soul is searching for Surma. While tying her hair, she sits silently, as if she is waiting for Surma to come and tie her hair. No, no, the evening came, the night came, Surma didn't come again. No more hair ties. Today Biva's face has become so dirty, today Biva is crying so much, yet why didn't Surma come, Surma never does that. As soon as Beaver's face gets a little dirty, Surma comes to him, grabs his throat, and tries to drink his mouth. And today--hey, he won't come even if his chest is broken today.

Half of Udayaditya's balls and half of his life are gone. In every work he had hope, encouragement, whose counsel was his only help, whose smile was his only reward--he was gone. He would go to his bedroom, wondering what to do, look around, see - no one. He used to come and sit in that bed slowly; He used to leave the place where Surma was sitting empty--that Jyotsna in the sky, that Kanan in front, the wind was blowing like that--he thought, would Surma be able to come and stay in such an evening?

He used to feel as if he heard the sound of someone's voice like Surma, he would get startled, even though it seemed impossible, he would look around once, go to bed once, see if anyone was there or not. Udayaditya who was busy with hundreds of small tasks all day, the poor people would come to him with gifts of fruits and vegetables from their fields and gardens, he would inquire and advise them; These days, he can't do all that anymore, yet he gets tired in the evening and comes to bed tiredly, as if there is a hope in his mind that as soon as he opens the door of the bedroom, he will see Surma sitting on that bed. When Udayaditya saw Vivah wandering alone with a pale face, his soul burst into tears. He called Bibha close, caressed her, told her how much he loved her, finally Bibha cried holding her grandfather's hand, and Udayaditya's eyes also began to shed tears. One day Udayaditya called Viva and said, "Viva, who else lives in this house? Let me arrange for you to be sent to your in-laws' house. What do you say? Don't be shy with me Viva. Who else will you express your heart to?" Viva remained silent. Didn't say anything. Do I need to ask this? Does he want to stay in his father's house? In the world where he has the only meeting place, his soul will not be restless to go to that moon island? But not a single person came to take him! Why did not come?

Udayaditya once proposed to his father to send Viva to his in-laws. Pratapaditya said, "I have no objection to sending Viva to her in-laws. But if they had any love for Viva, they would have sent people themselves to take Viva. I do not see the need for us to be so busy."

Rajamahishi cries seeing Viva. Beaver's dead widow can be seen in the eye? Seeing Beaver's pitiful face, a shell hit his soul. Apart from that, Mahishi loves his son-in-law very much, he does not like the consequences of what he has done as a boy. He went to Maharaj and begged, "Maharaj, send Viva to her in-laws' house." Maharaja got angry, saying "I have heard that one many times, don't bother me. When they ask Vivah for alms, they will get Vivah." Mahishi said, "What will ten people say if the girl does not go to her in-laws' house for a long time?" Pratapaditya said, "And if Pratapaditya himself sends the girl to Sadhya and if Ramachandra Ray drives her away from the door, what will the ten say?"

Mahishi cried and thought, what the Maharaja does from time to time has no address.

# Chapter 19

Raja Ramachandra Roy's keen eye for humiliation. One day the king went out on the street with a chaturdola, two inexperienced weavers were sitting in front of their cottage and weaving, they did not stand up when they saw the chaturdola, the king took it and lifted it up. Once in Jessohar, he ordered a servant of his father-in-law's house to do something, the poor man listened to it again and again, made a mistake in the work, Mahamani Ramchandra Roy decided from this that the servants of the father-in-law's house did not obey him. They would not have dared if they had not learned this from their masters. Especially that morning, he had seen Prince Udayaditya whispering something to that servant - of course, he was planning to insult him, if not what else could happen. One day a few boys were playing with the throne of the earthen mound, the king, the minister and the councilor Sajia Rajsabha. When it came to the king's ears, he called their fathers and disciplined them.

Today the Maharaja is leaning on the mattress and gurgling. A cowardly poor criminal is standing in front, his trial is going on. That person heard about Pratapaditya and Ramachandra Ray from some source and discussed it among themselves, and one of his enemies brought it to the king's ear. The king was very angry and summoned him. Either hang him or exile him, such a case has been made.

The king says, "Son, you are so worthy!"

She cried, "My lord, I have not done such a thing."

"Son, compare our maharaja with Pratapaditya," said the minister.

Dewan says, "Son, don't you know that when Pratapaditya's father became the first king, he appealed to our Maharaja's heavenly grandfather to enthrone him. To much weeping, he ennobled him with his finger on his left foot."

Ramai Bhand says, "Pratapaditya, the son of Vikramaditya, those two men are kings! Pratapaditya's grandfather was an earthworm, the earthworm's son became a leech, the son of the leech became swollen after eating the blood of his people. Today, the son of the leech digs his head and raises his head like a snake. Learned. We are coming to the palace in order of men, we are in the Vedas, we do not know caste-snake?" Raja Ramachandra Ray Bisham was satisfied and started to pull Gurguri in Sahasyavadan. These days there is an attack on Pratapaditya every day. The meeting broke up when Pratapaditya's face was deliberately pelted with offensive words and arrows, and the soldiers were exhausted. In any case, Dordandapratap Ramchandra Roy said, "Well, you have survived this journey, be careful in the future."

The rest of the council went away, only the minister and Ramai Bhand remained with the king. Pratapaditya started talking.

Ramai said, "You went away, meanwhile, Yuvraj Babaji fell into a strange situation. The king's intention was that if the daughter became a widow, some money would come into the treasury by selling the hand iron and bala two trees. Yuvraj interfered with it. What a shame!"

The king laughed, said, "That's it!"

The minister said, "Maharaj, I hear that Pratapaditya is recovering from regret these days. He is not able to sleep because of how he will send his daughter to his in-laws."

"True or not," said the king. Balia started to laugh, started smoking tobacco, felt very happy.

The minister said, "I said, there is no use in sending the daughter to the in-laws' house. The Maharaj has married in your house, and this is why seven of your men have been saved. After that, bringing your daughter home and bringing down the house, you have not done such a good thing yet. How is it, O Tagore!" "

Ramai said, "He has doubts! Maharaj, the one you stepped on is the fate of the father of the father, but why don't you wash your feet when you enter the house!"

Thus began the hilarity. Placing imaginary images of Pratapaditya and Udayaditya in front of them, they began to be wounded. I do not understand the crime of Udayaditya. He saved Ramchandra Ray's life by ignoring the danger, all the talk went down the drain, and Ramchandra Ray began to make fun of him for this crime of being the son of Pratapaditya. Ramachandra Roy is not cruel, he is a small-hearted, narrow-minded person. He is not grateful to Udayaditya for saving his life. He thinks that it will happen, it is wrong not to happen. If Ramchandra Ray is in danger, why not save him all together! He thinks that the thorn in Ramchandra Ray's feet will cause pain in the souls of all the worlds. He cannot think that Maharajadhiraja Ramachandra Roy is nothing to his own danger even to the smallest person in the world. By weighing the world on one side and himself on the other in the scales of hundreds of eulogists day and night, he has set himself heavy in the weight, so that his gratitude does not easily rise above anyone else. Apart from that, another reason for not showing gratitude towards Udayaditya is that he thinks that Udayaditya saved him for his own sister, saving her life was not the intention of Udayaditya. Besides, even if Ramachandra had been filled with gratitude in his heart, he would not have made the mistake of joking with Udayaditya. For where ten men are laughing at one, especially at whom Ramai Bhand is mocking, he does not have the strength of mind to shut up their mouths or not join them. He thinks, then what will everyone think?

There is still a feeling of Ramachandra Roy's attachment to Biva. Viva is beautiful, Viva has just entered puberty. Biva met Ramachandra Roy very few days ago. showed neglect to Pratapaditya--but when he first broke sleep that night, he saw Viva sitting on the bed and crying, her face was full of tears, her half-bare chest was trembling, her sweet pity eyes were watering, her tiny two Shivering like a child, a sudden rush of excitement came to his mind, he put Beaver's head in his lap, wiped away the tears, an impulse to kiss Beaver's soul came, for the first time his body was electrified, for the first time he became Beaver. He saw the beauty of youth, that first time his breath was fast, tears appeared in his half-closed eyes, his heart began to beat. He went to kiss Viva. At that time the door was hit, at that time he heard the news of danger. The first development of the heart, the first excitement of the desire, the fascination of the eye, were not satisfied, so they kept on possessing the memory of Ramachandra Ray. It is not a feeling of permanent love, because it is not possible for the tender heart of Ramachandra Ray. Just as a lover's heart feels an immediate pull towards a luxury, so did the lover Ramachandra Roy have a similar feeling towards Viva. Be that as it may, for whatever reason Ramachandra Ray's youthful dreams were troubled. An ambition arose in him to get his wife. But if you send Viva, then what will everyone think! The councilors will think of him as a woman, the minister will be dissatisfied, Ramai Bhand will laugh! Besides, what was the punishment for Pratapaditya? Where was revenge on the father-in-law? He has no confidence, no inclination to send for Viva after thinking seven or five like this. In fact, the jokes about Viva continue, he does not dare to stop it, and he does not want to stop it, thinking of Pratapaditya.

When Ramai Bhand and the minister left, Rammohan Mal came and said, "Maharaj."

The king said, "What Rammohan."

Rammohan. Maharaja, order, I go to fetch Thakurani.

The king said, "What is he talking about!"

Rammohan said, "Ajna yes. Anthapura is empty, I cannot see it. I go to Anthapura, I do not see anyone in the house of Maharaj, how is my life going. Let my mother Lakshmi come to the house and brighten the house. "

The king said, "Rammohan, have you gone mad? Did I bring that girl home?"

Ram Mohan's eyes widened and said, "Why, Maharaj, what crime has my mother-in-law committed?"

The king said, "Say what Rammohan. Shall I bring Pratapaditya's daughter home?"

Rammohan said, "Why don't you bring her? What is her relationship with Pratapaditya? A girl belongs to her father until she is married; after marriage she has no father's right. Now your buffalo is yours--if you do not bring her home, if you do not respect her." If you do, who else will?"

The king said, "That I have married the daughter of Pratapaditya, this is enough, shall I bring her home again? Then how will honor be saved?"

Rammohan said, "Protection of dignity? You have left your own buffalo in the next room, you have no right over him, other people can dominate him as they wish, is this protecting your dignity?"

The king said, "What if Pratapaditya does not give the girl?"

Rammohan puffed out his huge chest and said, "What did the king say? If he does not give? Who would not give so much power? My mother-Jani, the mother-Lakshmi of our house, whose power can keep him from us? No matter how great his power, his hand I will take it. I said this. I will bring my mother, who are you to stop me?" Saying this, Rammohan started to leave.

The king hurriedly said, "Rammohan, don't go, listen, listen. Well, there is no objection to you going and fetching the buffalo, but-- see, let no one hear this. Let not Rama or the minister hear this."

Rammohan said, "That order, Your Majesty." Said and left.

Although the buffalo will be known only when it arrives at Rajpur, yet there is a long delay, there is time to prepare for it. Ramchandra Roy survived only if he could avoid the hands of present shame.

# Chapter 20

What makes Udayaditya happy, day and night is the only effort. He does all his work with his own hands. He brings his food himself, sits in the front during meals, does not allow mistakes in even the slightest matter. When Udayaditya comes to his room in the evening, sits silently covering his eyes with his hands, his eyes watering, Viva slowly comes and sits at his feet - trying to speak, but nothing. Both of them are stunned, no one has a word. The light of the dirty lamp flickered and trembled at times, along with a shadow of darkness on the wall, Viva stayed silent for a long time and stared at the shadow, breathing heavily and crying, "Dada, where did he go?" Udayaditya got up startled, removed his blindfold and looked at Biva's face, as if he could not understand what Biva said, as if he was trying to understand it, suddenly became conscious, quickly wiped his tears and came to Biva and said, "Ai Biva tell me a story. "

The rainy day is very cloudy, it is raining all day. As the day darkened, the plants in the garden stood still and soaked. Every now and then the wind is blowing and the rain is coming into the room. Udayaditya is sitting silently. Clouds are calling in the sky, electricity is losing on the horizon. The incessant sound of the rain just seems to say, "Surma Nai--She Nai." Sometimes the humid wind comes and says, "Where is the antimony!" Viva slowly approached Udayaditya and said, "Dada." Dada can't answer anymore, seeing Viva, he covered his face and put his head on blanket, rain started falling on his head. Thus the day passes, the evening comes, the night begins. Biva prepared food for Udayaditya and came again saying, "Dada, the food has arrived, eat it." Udayaditya does not reply. The night started getting longer. Biva cries and says, "Dada get up, it's night." Udayaditya raised his face and saw Viva crying, got up quickly and wiped Viva's eyes and went to eat. Do not eat well. Seeing this, Viva sighs and goes to sleep, she does not touch food again.

Viva tries to talk, to tell stories, but Viva cannot say much. Udayaditya cannot think of what to do to keep him happy. He only thinks, Oh, if Grandpa had lived!

What a fear has appeared in Udayaditya's mind these days. He is very afraid of Pratapaditya. And he does not have the courage before. Knowing the danger, they can no longer fight against the tyranny. He hesitates in all activities, doubts appear in all matters.

One day Udayaditya heard that the zamindar of Chapra had been ordered to send sticks to the Kachari at night and loot the Kachari and set fire to the Kachari. Udayaditya immediately ordered his horse to be prepared and went to Anthapura. He entered the bedroom and looked around. What did you think? After thinking about it, he started to change his mind. came out The servant came and said, "Prince, the horse is ready. Where should we go?" Yuvraj looked at the servant's face with a different mind for a while and finally said, "Nowhere. You take the horse."

One day Udayaditya came out after hearing the sound of crying and saw that the royal servant was tying and killing a subject. The people wept and looked at the Prince's face and said, "God bless you Prince". Yuvraj could not see her pain, quickly ran and entered the house. Earlier, he used to stop the employee without judging the result, and tried to protect the people.

Bhagwat and Sitaram scholarship is closed! The prince no longer dares to help them openly or secretly. Whenever he hears about their suffering, he thinks, "I will send the money today." After that, he hesitated, it was not sent anymore.

Let no one think that Udayaditya is doing this out of fear for his life. It is not the special attachment he has recently developed to life. A blind fear appeared in his mind. He thinks Pratapaditya is something mysterious. As if Udayaditya's invisible, every moment of Udayaditya's future life is in Pratapaditya's grasp. When Udayaditya is about to embrace death, standing at the last moment of his life, if Pratapaditya frowns and orders him to live, it is as if he still has to come back from the face of death.

# Chapter 21

Widow Rukmini (Mangla) has little cash. He earns his living by withdrawing that money and taking interest. He has subdued many by the power of Rupa and Rupa. Sitaram is a passionate man, but does not have a single penny at home, so he has a sincere attraction to both Rukmini's looks and silver. On the day when the pot is crying in the house, see Sitaram, Divya is walking along the road with a stick in his hand with a stick in his face and a puffed chest, he will go to Mangala's house. If someone asks on the way, "How is the family, O Sitaram?" Sitaram immediately said, "It's going well. We have your invitation there tomorrow." Sitaram's big words have not decreased at all, but as the situation worsens, the amount of words has become longer and wider. Sitaram's condition went from bad to worse. It has recently come to pass that Pisa intends to renounce his honorary scholarship and return to his homeland.

Today money has become a special need, Sitaram has come to Rukmini's house. Husiya approached and said--

"If Rye gives alms,

(I) have no business in gold and silver,

(I) have come for life, O

Maan Ratan wants alms.

No brother, the rhyme is not correct. I don't really need Man Ratna for now, if it becomes necessary I will see later, for now it is useful to get some gold and silver."

Rukmini immediately expressed special affection and said, "If it is necessary for you, I will not give it to you, but to whom?"

Sitaram quickly said, "No--that is necessary. But you know, brother, my mother has money, I don't keep money in my own hands. This morning mother went to her son-in-law's house in Joragatha. She forgot to give the money out. I will repay it tomorrow." I'll do it."

Mangala said with a smile, "What is the need for you to do it so quickly? You will have to pay when it is convenient. I am giving it to you, I am not throwing it into the water." Even if you throw it in the water, there is a possibility of getting it, if you give it to Sitaram, there is not even that possibility, this is the difference.

Seeing such signs of affection from Mangala, Sitaram's love became completely empty. Sitaram ventured to make a joke. It is Sitaram's nature to make nawabi without money and make jokes without humor. He says whatever comes to his mouth and laughs by himself without waiting for anyone else. Seeing his smile makes me smile. When he was a guard in the palace, Sitaram along with other guards would almost occasionally start a riot, mainly because Sitaram thought it was fun and everyone else didn't. As Hanumanprasad Tewari was slouching to guard, Sitaram went slowly behind him and suddenly gave him such a blow on the back that his back and bile burned together with the bone-breaking joke. Sitaram started to laugh out loud, but Hanumanprasad did not join in the laughter, explaining to Sitaram very clearly the difference of humor with the kill and the relationship of Karuna Rasa. Hundreds more such stories of Sitaram's jokes could be quoted here.

As mentioned earlier, Sitaram's affections suddenly evaporated, he approached Rukmini and said lovingly, "You are my Subhadra, I am your Jagannath!"

Rukmini said, "Mor minse. Subhadra is Jagannath's sister!"

Sitaram said, "How will that happen? If so, how did Subhadrahana happen?"

Rukmini started to laugh, Sitaram puffed up his chest and said, "No, it won't happen, it won't happen if you laugh, answer me. If Subhadra is a sister, then how did Subhadra get married?"

Sitaram believes that he has applied such strong arguments that there is no point in talking about it.

Rukmini said in a very sweet voice, "Stupid fool."

Sitaram went and said, "I am a fool, I am lost to you brother, I am forever a fool to you." Sitaram thought to himself, I have given a lot of answers, I have given enough words.

He said again, "Well, brother, if you don't like it, tell me what you would be happy to call it."

Rukmini laughed and said, "Say Prana."

Sitaram said, "Soul."

Rukmini said, "Tell me dear."

Sitaram said, "Darling."

Rukmini said, "Tell me dear."

Sitaram said, "My dear."

Rukmini said, "Say dear."

Sitaram said, "Pranpriye. Well, brother Pranpriye, how much interest will you get on the money you gave?"

Rukmini got angry, bowed her face and said, "Go, go, this is your love. Why did you ask about interest?"

Sitaram was excited with joy and said, "No, no, what is it? Was I telling the truth, brother? Can't you understand the joke I was making? My dear."

I don't know what ailment Sitaram's mother got, these days she started going to her in-laws house almost every now and then and her memory about giving out money completely disappeared. So Sitaram had to come to Rukmini almost every now and then. These days it is seen that Sitaram and Rukmini are secretly discussing something between Milia. After a long consultation, Sitaram said, "My brother does not come to Fandi, it will not work without Bhagwat's help in this matter."

That evening there is a very storm. The door of the palace is hesitating. The wind is blowing so fast that the branches of the big trees in the garden are touching the ground. Clouds are scattered in the face of the storm like a broken village in the face of a flood. Frequent lightning, frequent thunder. Udayaditya is sitting with the little girl in his lap with the door closed around him. The lamp of the house has been extinguished. The room is dark. The girl is sleeping on his lap. When Surma was alive, this girl was very much loved. After Surma's death, her mother did not send her to the palace. After many days he came to visit the palace once today. Suddenly seeing Udayaditya, she jumped on his lap saying "uncle" "uncle". Udayaditya holds her on his chest and brings her to his bedroom. Udayaditya's mind is that if Surma comes to see this girl once. He loves her very much. There was so much love, can he not come and stay? The girl once asked, "Uncle, where is aunt?"

Udayaditya said sternly, "Don't call him once." The girl started calling "Kakima" "Kakima". Udayaditya thought who answered. It was as if someone said from a distance, "Let's go." It was as if Snehmayi couldn't stay any longer after hearing the pitiful call of Sneh's daughter. The girl fell asleep on his lap. Udayaditya extinguished the lamp. He sat alone in a dark room with a sleeping girl in his arms. The wind is blowing outside. There is a sound of hesitation. Did you hear that word? The word is. The chest is rumbling so that the sound is not heard well. The door opened, light entered the room. Is this ever possible? A woman quietly entered the room with a lamp in her hand. Udayaditya closed his eyes and said, "What is Surma?" If you see Surma, Surma will go away. Lest Surma not be.

The lady kept the lamp and said, "Why sing, don't you remember me anymore."

Hearing the sound of thunder broke the dream. Udayaditya got up startled and searched his eyes. The girl woke up and cried "uncle". Throwing him on the bed, Udayaditya stood up. What to do and where to go as if not thinking. Rukmini came to her and shook her face and said, "I tell you, I don't remember now. But why did you raise your hopes to the sky once?" Udayaditya stood silently, unable to speak.

Then Rukmini took out her brahmastra. Crying and said, "What fault have I done to you, that I became your eyeball. You are the one who destroyed me. The woman who sold the prince for her life one day is wandering the streets like a beggar today. Did the god write this on this burnt forehead?"

This time Udayaditya's life was struck. Suddenly he thought that I had destroyed it. He forgot about the past. He forgot how Rukmini had seduced him step by step in the prime of his youth, every day she sat in front of his path, casting a net in front of him, surrounded him like a whirlwind with her two enchanting arms and threw him into the darkness of the underworld in a moment - he forgot everything. He saw Rukmini's clothes dirty and torn. Rukmini is crying. Compassionate Udayaditya said, "What do you want?"

Rukmini said, "I don't want anything else, I want my love. I want to sit on that bed and put my face on your chest and get your favor. Why, sing, is this face blacker than Surma? If it is black, then she has traveled all the way for you. It wasn't black before!"

Saying this, Rukmini went to sit on Udayaditya's bed. Udayaditya could not stay any longer. He got up and said, "And don't sit on the bed, don't sit."

Rukmini raised her head like a wounded Fanini and said, "Why don't I sit?"

Udayaditya blocked his way and said, "No, don't you go near that bed. I will give you what you want now."

Rukmini said, "Well, give me that ring on your finger."

Udayaditya immediately removed the ring from her hand. Rukmini picked it up and went out. I thought that Dakini's enchantment has not gone away yet, let it be a few more days, after that my spell will work. When Rukmini left, Udayaditya fell on the bed. Covering his face with both arms, he cried, "Where, where is Surma? Who will give peace to my burning heart?"

# Chapter 22

Bhagwat's condition is not very good. He sat quietly for several days and continued to blow tobacco. As Bhagwat puffs his tobacco intently, the neighbors are alarmed. Because, the black smoke keeps rising from his mouth, a black cycle factory is also running in his mind. But Bhagwat the man is very religious. He doesn't mix with anyone, which is his fault, wears a garland of Harinam, doesn't talk much, doesn't gossip. But when one is in dire straits, no one can offer advice as seasoned as Bhagwat. Bhagwat never intentionally harms others, but if someone harms him, then Bhagwat never forgets it in this life, after taking his revenge, he keeps it down. In a word, that which is called good in the world, is Bhagavat. The people of the neighborhood also obeyed him, borrowed Bhagwat in distress, but paid it back by selling the pot.

One morning Sitaram came and asked Bhagwat, "Dada, how are you?"

"Not good," said Bhagwat.

Sitaram said, "Why tell me?"

Bhagwat smoked for a while and shook Sitaram's hand and said, "There has been a big fight."

Sitaram said, "So? How did it happen?"

Bhagwat got a little angry and said, "How did it happen? Do you have to tell me that too? I knew that I was in the same situation as you."

Sitaram said somewhat unprepared, "No, I'm not saying that, I'm saying why don't you borrow?"

Bhagwat said, "If you borrow, you will have to purify yourself. What is purification? There is not much to sell and bind."

Sitaram proudly said, "How much money you want to borrow, I will give."

Bhagwat said, "So? If you have so much money that even if you throw a handful in water, nothing will come out, then give me the whole ten. But I tell you in advance, I do not have the power to heal!"

Sitaram said, "That's why you don't have to worry, Dada."

It is not that Bhagwat, who had become extremely elated with the excitement of friendship, was not very happy with the hope of getting such help from Sitaram. And one of them sat quietly and started smoking tobacco.

Sitaram spoke slowly, "Dada, our food has died due to the unjust judgment of the king."

Bhagwat said, "You didn't think that!" Bhagwat did not like Sitaram's rudeness, something was wrong in his mind.

Sitaram said, "No brother, I'm talking about words! If it doesn't go today, it will go after ten days."

Bhagavata said, "What can we do if that king judges unjustly."

Sitaram said, "Oh, when Yuvraj becomes king, there will be Ramrajtva in Jessore, till then may we live."

Bhagwat sat down and said, "What do we do with all these words, brother? You are a big man, you sit in your house and beat the king-vizier, he is decorated. I am a poor man, I do not trust so much."

Sitaram said, "Why are you angry, grandfather? Why don't you listen with your heart?" Balia quietly said what he wanted to say.

Bhagavata became very angry and said, "Look Sitaram, I tell you clearly, you should not utter such words to me."

Sitaram left that day. Bhagwat spent the whole day thinking about something with great concentration, the next morning he himself went to Sitaram. Said to Sitaram, "What you said yesterday was a very mature thing."

Sitaram became proud and said, "How come, grandfather, I didn't say!"

Bhagwat said, "I have come today to consult you about that."

Sitaram became more proud. A series of consultations took place over several days.

After consultation, it was decided that a fake application should be written, as if the prince was applying for the kingdom himself, alleging rebellion against the emperor in the name of Pratapaditya. The Prince's seal will be printed on it. The ring that Rukmini has brought has the Prince's name-stamped seal on it, so the work is well advanced.

Worked as suggested. A fake application was written, with the Prince's name printed on it. The naive Sitaram could not be trusted, so it was decided that Bhagwat himself would take the petition and hand it over to Delhishwar.

Bhagavata took the petition and went to Pratapaditya instead of going to Delhi. Said to Maharaja, "A servant of Udayaditya was going towards Delhi with this request, I can know from some source. The servant has fled the country, I am coming to Maharaj with this request." Bhagwat did not name Sitaram. After reading the application, it is not necessary to say what happened to Pratapaditya. Bhagwat once again got a job in the royal palace.

# Chapter 23

Beaver has brought darkness into his soul. In the future, it is as if a heartbreaking sorrow, a desolate despair, the flood of all the happiness of life is waiting for him, every moment is coming closer to him. That life-destroying, omnivorous, arid, boundless fear of the future, a shadow of which has fallen into Beaver's soul. How is the beaver inside the mind? Viva is lying alone on the bed. At this time there is no one near Biva. Biva sighed, Biva wept, Biva yearned and said, "Did you abandon me? What crime have I committed to you?" He began to cry and say, "What crime have I committed?" Covering her face with both hands and taking a pillow to her chest, she cried and said repeatedly, "What have I done? Not a single letter, not a single person came, I do not hear news from anyone. What should I do? I am wandering from house to house all day long, No one tells you news, I can't hear your name in anyone's mouth. Mother go mother, how will you spend the day." How many days have passed? How many afternoons, afternoons, and nights, unaccompanied Biva roamed the empty rooms of the palace like a thin shadow.

At that time one day in the morning Rammohan came and bowed saying "Ma go jai hok", Viva was startled as if a thunderbolt of happiness broke in her head. Water came out of his eyes. He was shocked and said, "Mohan, you are here!"

"Yes, mother, I see, mother has forgotten us, let's remind her once."

Bibha thought of asking what to ask but she couldn't be shy - she didn't say it, but her heart was longing to hear it.

Rammohan looked at Biva's face and said, "Mom, why is your face so dirty? You have black eyes. No smile on your face. Hair is rough. Come, mother, come to our house. There is no one here to take care of you."

Viva smiled faintly, but said nothing. There was no longer a smile after a smile. Tears began to fall from both eyes-- The tears started to fall, flooding the pale pale cheeks, and the tears did not stop. After a long time of being unloved, the pride that rose up when she got a little love, Viva wept with that tender, gentle, eternally loving pride. He said to himself, "Did you remember me after so long?"

Rammohan couldn't stay any longer, tears came to his eyes, he said, "What a sign this is. Maa Lakshmi, you come to our house with a smile. Today is a good day, wipe away your tears."

Mahishi was afraid that the son-in-law would not accept his daughter. He was overjoyed to hear that Rammohan had come to fetch Viva. He called Rammohan and inquired about the merits of the in-laws, fed Rammohan with special care, listened to Rammohan's story, spent the day happily. Tomorrow is a good day for travel, it is decided to send Viva tomorrow morning. Pratapaditya did not object to this.

When everything was settled for the journey, Viva once went to Udayaditya. Udayaditya was sitting alone thinking about something.

Seeing Viva, Ishat was shocked and said, "Viva, but you left? It's good. May you live happily. I bless you as Lakshmi and brighten up your husband's house."

Viva fell at Udayaditya's feet and began to cry. Udayaditya's eyes began to water, putting his hands on Biva's head he said, "Why are you crying? What happiness did you have here Biva, all around is sorrow and grief. You escaped from this prison - you survived."

When Viva got up, Udayaditya said, "Are you going? But come. Go to Swamigriha and don't forget us at all. Remember once in a while, let us get news from time to time."

Viva went to Rammohan and said, "I can't go now."

Rammohan was surprised and said, "What is she talking about?"

Viva said, "No, I can't go. I can't leave Dada alone now. He is suffering so much because of me and I am going to leave him here today and enjoy happiness? As long as there is only pain in his mind, then I will be with him. Stay with me. Who will take care of him like me here?" Saying that, Viva went away crying.

A commotion broke out in Anthapura. Mahishi came and scolded Vivah, scared her a lot, gave her a lot of advice. Viva simply said, "No mom, I can't."

Mahishi cried in anger and said, "I have never seen such a girl anywhere." He went to Maharaj and told everything. Maharaj calmly said, "That's enough, if the beaver doesn't want to go, why go?"

Mahishi was surprised, threw up his hands, gave up and said, "Do whatever you want, I will not hold on to any more words."

Udayaditya was surprised to hear all this. He came and explained a lot to Viva. Viva began to cry silently, did not understand well.

Despondent Rammohan came and said with a pale face, "Mother, I am going. What shall I say to Maharaj?"

Viva could not say anything, remained unanswered for a long time.

Rammohan said, "But goodbye, mother." He bowed and got up. Biva cried out in agony, called out in a pitiful voice, "Mohan."

Mohan came back and said, "What mother?"

Biva said, "Tell the Maharaj to pardon me. He is calling himself, but I could not go, he is only my far-sighted."

"That order," said Rammohan dryly.

Ram Mohan bowed again and left. Biva saw that Rammohan could not understand anything of Biva's thoughts, his heavy noise was blocking him. Where Viva's soul wanted to go, Viva could not go there. Rammohan, whom he loved dearly, got angry and left today. Vivah knows what happened in Vivah's life.

Viva remained. Wiping the tears from his eyes, he fell to his grandfather with a heavy heart. Like a faint shadow she silently works all around the house. Udayaditya lowers his eyes and smiles a little when he says something lovingly and caressingly. In the evening he sat at Udayaditya's feet and tried to talk a little. When the buffalo says something reprimanding, he stands quietly and listens and finally floats away like a piece of dirty cloud; When someone grabs Beaver's chin and says, "Beaver, why are you so thin?" Viva doesn't say anything, just smiles a little.

At this time, Bhagavata took the aforementioned fake petition and showed it to Pratapaditya, Pratapaditya became enraged, after much deliberation he ordered Udayaditya to be imprisoned. The minister said, "Maharaj, Yuvraj has done this thing, it is not believable at all. He who hears it says that his tongue is cut, he should not listen to it. It is not believable that Yuvraj would do this." Pratapaditya said, "I don't have much faith either. But saying that, what's wrong with being in prison? If you don't give any kind of trouble there. Only if you can't do anything secretly, a guard will be appointed for him."

# Chapter 24

When Rammohan returned to Chandradwip and stood before the king with outstretched arms like a criminal, Ramachandra Ray's whole body burned. He had decided that after Bibha's arrival, he would make him pay for his father-in-law by telling him two or four bad things about Pratapaditya and his family. He had decided what to say, how to say it, when to say it. Ramchandra Roy is not a Goan, it was not his intention to harass Viva in any way. He was only impatient with the pleasure of making Vivah very ashamed of her father at times. Even under the influence of this joy, he did not think that there could be any obstacle for the beaver to come. Seeing Rammohan coming alone at such a time, Ramchandra Roy was completely surprised and said, "What happened, Rammohan?"

Rammohan said, "All in vain."

The king was surprised and said, "Can't you bring it?"

Rammohan. Command, no majesty! I traveled to Kulagne.

The king became very angry and said, "Son, who told you to travel? I forbade you again and again, when your chest swelled, and today--"

Rammohan put his hand on his forehead and said with a pale face, "Maharaj, it is the fault of my blindness."

Ramchandra Ray got even more angry and said, "Ramachandra Ray's insult! You son of a bitch went to beg in my name, and Pratapaditya did not give. We have never had such a big insult in our family."

Then Rammohan picked up Natshir and proudly said, "Don't talk. If Pratapaditya had not given it, I would have taken it away. I went to tell you that. When I go to carry out your orders, do I fear Pratapaditya? Pratapaditya is the king. , but he is not my king."

The king said, "But why didn't it happen?"

Rammohan remained silent for a long time, tears appeared in his eyes.

The king was impatient and said, "Rammohan, speak quickly!"

Rammohan said with raised hands, "Maharaj--

The king said, "Say what."

Rammohan. Maharaj, Ma-Thakrun did not want to come.

Rammohan's eyes began to water. I understand this child's tears of pride. I think the meaning of these tears - "I had so much faith in my mother that with the strength of that faith, I went to bring my mother with joy, and she did not come, she did not respect me." Old Ram Mohan couldn't hold back his tears, thinking about what he knows.

After hearing this, the king stood up and rolled his eyes and said, "That's it." For a long time he was speechless.

"You didn't want to come, boy! Get out, get out, get out of my face now."

Rammohan went out without saying a word. He knew all his fault, so getting the appropriate punishment is not wrong.

The king could not think of anything to repay it. You can't do anything great, you can't even get life. Ramchandra Roy got impatient and started walking.

Within a couple of days, the news spread in various forms. It became such a situation that if revenge is not taken, face is no longer saved. Even the citizens were busy taking revenge. They said, "Insult to our Maharaja!" As if the insult is on everyone. The instinct of revenge is naturally strong in Ramachandra Ray's mind, he thought about it, if he does not take revenge, what will the subjects think, what will the servants think, what will Ramai Bhand think? When he imagines that Rami is laughing and chirping at another person, he becomes very restless.

One day in the meeting the minister proposed, "Maharaj, you should have another marriage."

Ramai Bhand said, "And let Pratapaditya's daughter take her brother."

Raja looked at Ramai and smiled and said, "You are right Ramai." Seeing the king smiling, all the assembly began to laugh. Only Fernandez was annoyed, he didn't laugh. People like Ramachandra Roy are constantly busy to protect the dignity, but they do not know who the dignity is and how to maintain the dignity.

Dewanji said, "The Minister is right. Then Pratapaditya and his daughter will be given a proper education."

Ramai Bhand said, "Do not forget to send an invitation to your present father-in-law for this good deed, otherwise he may regret it." Biya rolled her eyes. Everyone in the meeting started laughing. Those who were sitting far away, could not hear the words, they also could not remain without laughing.

Ramai said, "For the purpose of reception, Jessore will send your mother-in-law, your mother-in-law. And Misthannamitarejna, when you send a bowl of sweets to Pratapaditya's daughter, then send two raw rambhas with her."

The king laughed and became restless. The members of the assembly began to smile, covering their faces with sheets. Fernandez got up and left unnoticed.

Dewanji once tried to make a joke, saying, "Misthannamitarejna:- If other people have sweets in their fortunes, then all the sweets will be consumed in Jessohar, there are no more people fit to eat sweets in Chandradwip."

No one laughed after hearing this. The king kept silent and began to mumble, the audience remained serious, Ramai looked at the Dewan in surprise, even one of the women asked in particular, "What is he talking about, Dewanji sir? Will the arrangement of sweets be so small at the king's wedding?" Dewanji Mahashay started scratching his head.

Everything about the marriage was settled.

# Chapter 25

The place where Udayaditya is confined is not a real prison; It is a small building adjacent to the palace. Just to the right of the bati is a highway and to the east of it is a broad wall, on which guards are patrolling. Cut a tiny window in the room. A bit of sky, a bamboo grove and a Shiva temple can be seen through it. When Udayaditya first entered the prison, evening had passed. He sat on the ground with his face near the window. rainy season There are clouds in the sky. Water is standing on the road. In the silent night two travelers are walking, the sound of their footsteps is heard. From the east, like the heartbeat of the prison, the footsteps of the guards keep coming to the ears. One by one it seemed from the past, one by one honk was heard from far away. There is not a single star in the sky. The bamboo tree that Udayaditya is looking towards is completely overshadowed by Jonaki. That night, Udayaditya did not sleep, but sat by the window and listened to the constant footsteps of the watchmen.

Biva went to Anthapura garden once this evening. There are many people in the palace. Maids all around, PC aunties all around, word by word asking "what's going on, what's the story", every tear has to be accounted for, every sigh has elaborate commentary and criticism pouring out. Viva can't understand anymore. Chuya has come to the garden. The sun today rose in the clouds, set in the clouds. It was not understood when the day ended and the evening began. A little golden streak appeared on the western face towards the afternoon, but it faded away before the end of the day. Darkness began to thicken upon darkness. The horizon became covered from horizon to horizon. Darkness settled over the heads of the dense bushes so that a gap between them could no longer be seen, it seemed as if a vast expanse of silent darkness was standing on a thousand long legs. As night fell, the lamps of the palace went out one by one. Biva is sitting under a bush. Viva is naturally timid, but today she is not afraid. Only the more darkness comes, the more he feels as if someone has taken the world away from him, as if someone has pushed him from the shores of the world from happiness to peace, he has fallen into the sea of deep darkness. It is sinking gradually, it is descending gradually, darkness is gradually building above the head, there is no land under the feet, there is nothing around. The sheltered coast is gradually moving away from the world. It seemed to him that little by little a huge gap was rising towards the sky in front of him. Many things were falling on him. The soul seemed to yearn. As if everyone is seen on the other side; The sunlight, the sports, the festivals are all seen there; It is as if someone is holding him with a cruel, hard hand, even if he pulls his chest vein and tears it, he will not let him go. Vivah has got divine eyes today; It is as if God has written the future of life invisible on this all-pervasive darkness, sitting alone in the eternal world, life is reading it; So there is no water in his eyes, his body is still, his eyes are empty. After two o'clock in the night a wind arose, the trees rustled in the darkness. The wind howled far away and the child's voice began to cry. Beaver felt as if the children of Beaver's love sitting far away on the shore of the sea are crying with both hands raised, yearning they are calling for Beaver, they want to come to her lap, they can't see the way ahead, as if their cries are hundreds of thousands of yojans dark. It reached Beaver's ears through the darkness. Biva's soul felt as if she said, "Who are you, who are you, who are you crying, where are you." Viva felt as if she had traveled alone on this thousand yojana path of darkness. He traveled tirelessly for a thousand years, never ending the journey, never seeing anyone. Only standing in that windless, soundless day and night, desolate, starless, horizonless great darkness, sometimes I could hear cries from all directions, only the wind started to say hoo hoo from far away.

The whole night was spent in sleeplessness. The next day Bibha tried hard to visit Udayaditya in prison, where he was forbidden to go. He cried a lot all day long. He even went to Pratapaditya himself. Viva held his leg. He agreed with great difficulty. The next day, before dawn, Viva got out of bed and entered the prison. Gia saw that Udayaditya was not listening in bed. Sitting on the ground and sleeping with his head on the mattress. Beaver's heart felt as if he wanted to burst into tears. It was with great difficulty that he held back his tears. Very slowly and silently went to Udayaditya and sat down. Gradually the dawn came clear. From the nearby forest, birds chirped. The panthers sang from the nearby road, and the watchmen, tired of two or three night vigils, saw the light and began to sing softly. The sound of conch bells rang out from the nearby temple. Udayaditya suddenly woke up startled. When he saw Viva, he said, "What is Viva, this early in the morning?" He looked around the room and said, "What is this, where am I?" In a moment I remembered where he was. He looked at Biva and sighed, "Ah! Biva, have you come? Yesterday I did not see you all day, I thought I would never see you again."

Viva came to Udayaditya and wiped her eyes and said, "Dada, why are you sitting on the ground? There are sheets on the bed. It seems that you have not sat on the bed even once. Have you been sitting on the ground these two days?" Balia Viva started crying.

Udayaditya slowly said, "I cannot see the sky when I sit on the bed. When I look at the sky through the window and see the birds flying, then I think that one day I too will break the cage, one day I will swim in the eternal sky like those birds. When I step out of this window, I see darkness all around, then I forget that one day I will be freed, one day I will be freed, I don't think that the shackles of life will be broken one day, I will be freed from this prison one day. There's two hands of land Where I come I know I'm free by nature; No king or queen can hold me prisoner. And yonder in that room is that soft bed, yonder is my prison."

Udayaditya was very happy to see Viva today. When Viva fell into his sight, all the gates of his prison were thrown open. On that day, he sat Bibha close to him and spoke so much happily that I think he never spoke so much before entering prison. Viva could understand Udayaditya's joy in his heart. I don't know how the message goes from one soul to another, if a wave is raised in one soul, in what order the wave is raised in another soul. Beaver's heart swelled. His long time goal was successful today. Viva is a little girl, she could easily understand the joy she could give Udayaditya after many days. He found the ball in his heart. For so long he had seen darkness all around him, he could not find an edge anywhere, he was completely bowed down by the weight of despair. He did not believe in himself; He continued to work for Udayaditya, but could not believe that he could make him happy. Today he suddenly got to see a way, all the trouble so far was completely forgotten. Today, tears appeared in his eyes like morning dew, today the pure smile of Arun-Kiran rose from his grasp.

Vivah almost became a prisoner. Every time dawn entered through the door of the house, the door of the prison was opened, and the idol of Biva appeared. Biva did not allow paid servants to do anything, did all the work with her own hands, brought food herself, made the bed herself. He brought a bird and hung it in the house and every morning he used to pick flowers from the garden of Antapur. There was a Mahabharata in the house, Udayaditya used to read it to Vivah sitting near him.

But Udayaditya's heart is troubled. He is sitting drowning, but why at such a time this incomplete-happiness-unsatisfied-hope Sukumar embraces Biva as shelter and drowns him? Every day I think, I will say to Viva, "You are Viva." But Biva took the wind of Usha and took the light of Usha and entered into the girl holding Usha's hand, when that treasure of love came and sat near Sukuma's face, looked at her face with such caring and loving eyes, and asked how many things in such a sweet tone, then she And you can't hold your breath and say, "Biva, you go, you don't come again, I won't see you again." Pratyah thinks, I will tell you tomorrow. But he doesn't want to come tomorrow at all. Finally one day he made a firm promise. Biva came, said to Biva, "Biva, you don't stay here anymore. If you don't go, I don't get any peace. Every evening in the darkness of this prison, who comes to me and tells me, Biva's danger is approaching. Biva, run away from me quickly. I am Shanigraha, when you see me, the danger of the country escapes from all around. You go to your father-in-law's house. If I get news sometimes, then I will be happy."

Viva remained silent.

Udayaditya bowed down and looked at Beaver's face for a long time. Tears began to fall from his two eyes. Udayaditya understood, "If I am not freed from prison, Vivah will never leave me, how can I be freed."

# Chapter 26

Ramachandra Roy thought that Bibha did not come to Chandradwip, but only under the rule of Pratapaditya and the ministry of Udayaditya. To think that Viva did not come of her own free will hurts her pride. He thought that Pratapaditya wanted to insult me, so he would never send Viva to me. But why don't I return this insult. Why don't I write a letter to him that your daughter whom I abandoned, should not be sent to Chandradwip again. Thinking like this seven or five people consulted together with five people and wrote a letter to Pratapaditya to that effect. Writing such a letter to Pratapaditya is no ordinary act of courage. Ramachandra Roy was always afraid. But Ramchandra Ray also had a similar feeling that he could not stop even though he was afraid to go up and down the steep mountain. Suddenly he is engaged in an adventure, he cannot stand until he reaches the end. He called Rammohan and said, "Take this letter to Jessohar." Rammohan said with folded hands, "No command, my lord, I cannot. I have decided not to go to Jessohar again. If you ask me to go and bring Mother Thakurani again, I can go one more time, otherwise I will not be able to take this letter." Without saying anything else to Rammohan, the king gave the letter to old Nayanchand. He took the letter and set off for Jessohar.

He took the letter, but Nayanchand was very afraid. I don't know what Pratapaditya did when he read this letter. After thinking a lot, he decided to give this letter to Chintia Mahishi. The state of mind of the buffalo is not very good. On the one hand his concern for Viva, on the other hand his suffering for Udayaditya. It is as if he has become completely overwhelmed by the noise of the world. Sometimes he is almost seen crying. He doesn't feel homesick anymore. In such a situation he received this letter - he did not know what to do. Can't tell Viva, otherwise Sukumar Viva won't survive. There is no address for what will happen if the word of this letter reaches the ear of the Maharaj. However, in such a crisis situation, Mahishi could not survive without saying anything to anyone, without taking any advice from anyone, seeing the unfavorable path around him, he went to Pratapaditya in tears. He said, "Maharaj, Beaver must do something."

Pratapaditya said, "Why tell me?"

Mahishi said, "No, nothing has happened, but Vivah will have to be sent to her in-laws at some point."

Prominence "I understand that, but after all this time you remembered it today?"

The buffalo was frightened and said, "That's one of your words, am I saying that something has happened? If something happens--"

Pratapaditya got annoyed and said, "What else will happen?"

the buffalo "Consider this if the son-in-law abandons the wife altogether." Saying this, Mahishi started to cry.

Pratapaditya became very angry. Fire came out of his eyes.

Seeing the image of Maharaj, Mahishi quickly wiped his tears and said, "So what else has the son-in-law written that is true, that I have abandoned your wife, don't send him to Chandradwip again, it's not-- but this is the thing, if he ever writes like that!"

Pratapaditya said, "Then I will make the necessary provisions for him, now there is no time to think about him."

The buffalo wept and said, "Maharaj, fall at your feet, keep me one word, think once and see what will happen to Beaver. My stone is still alive, otherwise you have given me as much pain as you want. Udaya--my child--the king's son is like a petty criminal." You have stopped me. He does not commit any crime to me, he does not indulge in anything, he does not understand anything in the fault, he has not learned kingship, he does not know how to rule the people, he does not have intelligence, what God has done to him, what is his fault." Saying that the buffalo started to cry twice.

Pratapaditya Isha got annoyed and said, "That has been said many times. Don't say what was said."

The buffalo hit his forehead and said, "My burnt forehead! What else can I say? Would you listen to me? Drink from the beaver's mouth once, my lord. He who does not say anything to anyone - he only dries up day by day, becomes like a shadow, but he He doesn't know how to speak. Make a way for him."

Pratapaditya was annoyed. Mahishi came back without saying anything else.

# Chapter 27

An incident has already occurred. When Sitaram saw that Udayaditya had been imprisoned, he could no longer live without arms and legs. First he went to Rukmini's house. He said whatever came to his mind. What else can kill him? He said, "Sarbanashi, I will light your house on fire, I will feed doves in your house, and I will free the Prince, but my name is Sitaram. Today I went to Raigarh, I am coming from Raigarh, after that I will take that black face of yours and rub it on this face, smear chalk ink on your face. I will drive you out of the city, but I will take water."

Rukmini listened for a while looking at Sitaram's face with her eyes, bit by bit her teeth, pressed her lips to her lips, her fists tightened, a cloud gathered over her dark eyebrows, electricity started to accumulate in her dark eyes, her whole body went numb; Gradually, his thick limbs began to tremble, his thick eyebrows fluttered, his dark eyes began to flash, his hair swelled, his arms and legs began to tremble. A demonic curse, an all-swelling trembling of jealousy fell upon Sitaram's head. At that moment Sitaram came out of the cottage. Gradually, when Rukmini's fists loosened, her teeth loosened, Adharushtha parted, her furrowed brows widened, she sat down and said, "So! Yuvraj is yours! Yuvraj is in danger, and you feel great--as if Yuvraj is none of my own." . Burning face, don't you know that he is my Yuvraj, I can do him good and I can do him bad. You want to free my Yuvraj. Let's see how you can do it."

Sitaram went to Raigarh that day.

In the afternoon Basant Roy is sitting on the balcony of Raigarh Palace. A wide field is seen in front. At the edge of the field, across the canal, the sun is setting in a dark forest. Basant Roy no longer has his ever-companion sitar. The old man looks at the setting sun and sings in your mind--

I am the only one left.

What was gone is gone, what remains is just an illusion

I told them that

And they don't respond.

Where are they, where are they? Cry and cry, who do you call?

Tell me, mother, correct you.

Did you keep anything for me?

I live a life with only me.

Who knows what thought the old man was singing this song. I understand that he was thinking, "I am singing, but those whom I used to listen to are gone. The song comes, but after singing there is no more happiness. I have not forgotten the joy, but whenever the joy is born, those who used to hug, where are they?" On the day when in the morning there was a cloud above that palm tree in Raigarh, my mind danced with joy on that day, whom I used to travel to Jessore to see.

Thinking of all this, looking at the setting sun in the afternoon, the old Vasant Roy sings spontaneously - I am the only one left.

At that time, Khan Sahib came and gave a great greeting. Seeing Khan Saheb, Basant Roy was excited and said, "Khan Saheb, come." He went closer and busily said, "Sir, why do I see your face so dirty? Are you in a good mood?"

Mr. Khan "Question no more about the mood, my lord. We have no more happiness in our hearts to see you dirty. There is one thing--I am no one at night, the moon that I hold in my head, I smile together with it, fade together!- - Your Majesty, what is our power to laugh if you do not laugh, we or who? We have no more happiness, sir."

Basant Roy was disturbed and said, "What is he talking about? I have no illness, I smile at myself, I live in my own happiness, what is my illness, sir?"

Mr. Khan "Maharaj, you can't hear much music now." Vasant Roy suddenly became serious and said, "Will you listen to my song, sir?

I am the only one left.

What was is gone,

All that remains is futility."

Mr. Khan "Where are you and that sitar player? Where is your sitar?"

Vasant Roy laughed and said, "It's not that she doesn't have a sitar. She only has a string that's torn, and she can't tune it anymore." Balia looked at Amraban and began to shake his head.

After a while Vasant Roy spoke up, "Khan sahib, don't sing a song--sing a song; sing, tajbe taj naobe nao."

Mr. Khan sang,

Tajbe Taj Naobe.

Vasant Roy got up and couldn't sit still. They stood up, started singing together--Tajbe Taj Naobe Nao. He began to beat frequently and began to sing repeatedly. Soon the sun went down, darkness came, the shepherds came home and started singing. At such a time Sitaram came and bowed down saying "Victory to the King". Basant Roy was completely startled and immediately stopped singing and quickly came to him and put his hand on him and said, "Hey Sitaram! How are you? How is grandpa? Where is grandpa? Is the news good?"

Mr. Khan left. Sitaram said, "I offer one by one, my lord." Balia told one by one about the imprisonment of Yuvraj. Sitaram did not speak the truth in advance. The reason for Udayaditya's imprisonment is not clearly stated.

Vasantha Roy's head was shattered, he held Sitaram's hand firmly. His eyebrows rose, his eyes widened, his expression changed--Nirnimesh looked at Sitaram's face with blank eyes and said, "Huh?"

Sitaram said, "Agna, yes majesty."

Vasant Roy kept silent for a while and said, "Sitaram!"

Sitaram. "Your Highness."

Vasant Roy. "Then where is grandfather now?"

Sitaram. "Command, he's in prison."

Basant Roy began to shake his head. In Udayaditya's prison, this is not settling well in his head, he cannot imagine anything. After a while, he held Sitaram's hand and said, "Sitaram!"

Sitaram. "Command Your Highness."

Vasant Roy. "So what is Grandpa doing now?"

Sitaram. "What else to do. He's in jail."

Vasant Roy. "Has everyone locked him up?"

Sitaram. "Command yes your majesty."

Vasant Roy. "Doesn't anyone let him out for once?"

Sitaram. "No order."

Vasant Roy. "He's sitting in solitary confinement?"

Vasant Roy did not ask any particular person these words - he said them automatically. Sitaram could not understand it -- he replied, "Yes, my lord."

Basant Roy said, "Dada, you come to me, no one knew you."

# Chapter 28

Vasant Roy left for Jessohar the next day. He did not obey anyone's prohibition. On reaching Jessohar, he went to the innermost part of the palace. Biva suddenly saw her grandfather as if what had happened. For a while, I could not think of anything to do. Only wonder in the eyes, unfathomable joy, no words in the mouth, body motionless - stood for a while, then fell at his feet and prostrated, took the dust of his feet on his head. When Viva stood up, Vasant Roy once looked at Viva's face with intense concentration and asked, "Viva?" Didn't say anything else, just asked, "Biva?" It was as if a faint hope arose in his mind that what Sitaram had said might not be true. Afraid to ask everything clearly lest Viva answers it. He doesn't want Viva to answer his question immediately. So he asked Biva's face with great fear, "Biva?" So he looked at her face very intently. Vivah understood and Vivah could not answer; His initial excitement is over. He remembers those days when Dada Mahashay used to come. What a festive day it has been. What a joy it was when he came. Surma laughed and joked, Viva laughed but could not joke, Dada Prashant used to listen to Dadamahashaya's songs in Anandamurthy. Grandfather came today, but no one else came to him, only Viva, standing alone in this dark world--the only remnant of the world of happiness standing by Grandfather. Why is Surma's house like this today when Grandpa Mahashay came to the house where there was a sound of joy? Today it is stagnant, dark, empty--the house will burst into tears if it sees Grandfather. Vasant Roy went to the front of the room with the assurance of something -- stood near the door and put his head inside the room and looked around, immediately turned his face and asked in a hoarse voice, "Didi, is there no one in the house?"

Biva cried, "No grandpa, no one."

The silent room seemed to say, "Those who were before are no one."

Basant Roy stood silent for a long time, finally took Biva's hand and slowly got up.

I am the only one left.

Vasant Rai went to Pratapaditya and pleaded, "Father Pratap, why bother Uday--what has he done to you? If you don't like him, if he commits crimes against you step by step, don't give him to this old man. I Take him--I'll keep him. He'll never see you again--he'll stay with me!"

Pratapaditya listened patiently for a long time and listened to Vasant Ray, finally said, "Khuramashaya, I have given much consideration to what I have done. You certainly know much less than I do about this--but you have come to advise, all these words of yours." I can't accept it."

Then Vasant Ray got up and came to Pratapaditya, holding Pratapaditya's hand and saying, "Father Pratap, don't you remember! Don't you remember that I carried you on my back as a child? From the day Heavenly Grandpa handed you over to me, I Have I troubled you for a moment? When you were helpless in my arms, could you even think of yourself as fatherless for a single day? Tell me, Pratap, what crime have I committed against you that you have caused me so much pain in my old age? Such things. I do not say that you are indebted to me for raising you--I have tried to repay my grandfather's love-debt by making you human. Therefore, Pratap, I do not demand anything from you as I deserve, never have, I only ask you for alms. I want -- won't you give me that?"

Basant Ray's eyes began to water, Pratapaditya remained sitting like a stone statue.

Basant Roy said again, "But don't listen to me, don't keep my begging? Will you answer with words, Pratap?" Sighing, he said, "Well, I have one more small request, I want to see Uday once. Let no one prevent me from entering his prison."

Pratapaditya did not give that either. Pratapaditya was very upset that Udayaditya showed so much affection against him. The more he feels people are making him a criminal, the more he bends.

Basant Roy went back to Anthapura with a very pale face, Beaver was very distressed to see his face. Viva held Grandpa's hand and said, "Grandpa, come to my house." Vasant Roy silently entered Beaver's room with Beaver. After he sat down in the room, Viva stroked his gray hair with her tender fingers and said, "Grandfather, come, let me lift your gray hair." Basant Roy said, "Didi, does she still have curly hair? When she was not old, she was all there, then I used to tell you to pluck her curly hair. Today I have become old, today I don't have curly hair anymore."

Vasant Roy saw that Biva's face became dirty, her eyes were glazed. Amani quickly said, "Ai Vivah Ai; remove all the hair. I can no longer supply you with fresh hair, brother. It was getting old, it was gradually falling on the head. Now search for another head, I replied." Basant Roy started laughing.

A maid came and said to Vasant Roy, "Ranima wants to bow to you once."

Basant Roy went to Mahishi's house, Viva went to jail.

Mahishi bowed to Vasant Roy. Basant Roy blessed, "Mother, be Ayushmati."

Mahishi said, "Uncle, don't bless me again. Now I will live only if I die."

Vasant Roy was busy and said, "Ram, Ram. Don't say that."

Mahishi said, "What else can I say, Kakamhashay, it is as if Saturn's gaze fell on my house crying."

Vasant Roy became more and more busy.

Mahishi said, "Seeing the face of the beaver, I don't taste food anymore. When I ask him, he doesn't say anything, only his body is deteriorating day by day. I can't think of anything to do with him."

Vasant Roy was very worried.

"Look uncle, here comes a letter from a ghost." He gave a letter to Vasant Roy.

Before Basant Ray could read the letter, Mahishi began to cry and said, "What happiness do I have? Uday - my son knows nothing. He is not like a king, but I conceived him, he is mine. It's your child. I don't know what the kid is doing there, he doesn't even let me see him once." Whatever words Mahishi reads these days, the words of Udayaditya come to a place in him. That pain is awake day and night in his soul.

Vasant Roy was completely surprised after reading the letter, sat silently and began to shake his head. After some time, Vasant Roy asked Mahishi, "Have you not shown this letter to anyone, mother!"

Mahishi said, "If your majesty hears about this letter, will you protect it, and will your wife survive if it happens?"

Basant Roy said, "You have done well. Don't show this letter to anyone else, wife. You send Vivah to her in-laws' house soon. Don't think of humiliation!"

Mahishi said, "I have thought the same. I have no business taking honor, I just want my wife to be happy. I am only afraid that they will not care for her."

Basant Roy said, "You will care for Viva! Viva is the treasure of carelessness. Viva will be adored wherever she goes. Where else is there such a golden idol like Lakshmi. Ramachandra wrote this letter only because he was angry with you, if you send it again, his anger will subside." Vasant Roy understood this in his simple heart and simple mind. Mahishi also understood that.

Vasant Roy said, "Go to state at home that Ramachandra has written a letter requesting Viva to be sent to Chandradwip. Then surely you will not hesitate to go there."

# Chapter 29

Basant Roy is sitting outside alone in the evening. At that time Sitaram came and bowed down to him.

Basant Roy asked him, "Ki Sitaram, what's up?"

Sitaram said, "I will tell you later, you will have to come with me."

Vasant Roy said, "Why, where is Sitaram?"

Sitaram then came near and sat. What did he say in a whisper? Basant Ray widened his eyes and said, "Is it true?"

Sitaram said, "Yes majesty."

Vasant Roy hesitated a lot in his mind. He said, "Shall we go now?"

Sitaram. command yes

Vasant Roy. Will not come to meet with Beaver?

Sitaram. No order, no time.

Vasant Roy. Where to go?

Sitaram. Come with me, I'll take you.

Basant Roy stood up and said, "Why don't you come and meet Viva?"

Sitaram. Do not order Maharaj. If it is late, all will be lost.

Vasant Roy. Hastily said, "But no work--no work." Both went.

He went a little further and said, "Isn't it okay if you delay a little?"

Sitaram. No, my lord, then there will be danger.

Saying "Durga" Vasant Rai went out of the palace.

Udayaditya does not know that Vasant Roy has come. Viva didn't tell him. For when there was no possibility of the two meeting, this news would have caused him distress. Bibha left the jail after evening farewell. Udayaditya reads a Sanskrit book with a lamp. The wind is coming through the window, the dim flame of the lamp is flickering, the letters are not visible. Insects come and fall on the lamp. The lamp is flickering one by one. Once the wind blew -- the lamp went out. Udayaditya jumped up and sat on his bed. How many thoughts came one by one. Beaver came to mind. Today Viva came late, left early in the morning. Today Viva had seen something particularly dim; That's what Leiya used to discuss in his mind. As if he has no one else in the world. He does not see anyone except his wife all day. Marriage is his only concern. Beaver's every smile and every word gets stored in his mind. As a thirsty person enjoys every drop of his drink, so he enjoys even the slightest trace of Beaver's love with his heart and soul. Today, this Bijan was lying alone in a small dark room thinking about the dim face of Beaver, the idol of love. Sitting in that darkness, he once thought, "Is the beaver gradually getting bored? Does he no longer like serving a gloomy dark idol in this dreary prison? Will he gradually see me as an obstacle to his happiness as a thorn in his way of life? Late today." It has come, tomorrow may come later, after that one day I may be sitting all day, when will Vivah come--afternoon, evening--night, Vivah will not come again.-- After that, Vivah may not come again. The more this thought dawned on Udayaditya, the more his mind began to cry -- what a terrible void he saw around his imaginary kingdom. A day would come when Viva would see him with loveless eyes as the pinnacle of her happiness, and his heart became very anxious at the mere glimpse of that far-fetched fantasy. Once he remembered, "What a terrible selfishness I am. I love Viva, the bitterest enmity I am doing to her, no enemy can feel." Vows again and again not to rely on Biva but whenever he imagines losing Biva, the ball moves in his mind, then he collapses on a cold rock -- clinging desperately to Biva's imaginary image like a dying man.

At that time, there was a loud noise outside saying "Fire--Fire". Udayaditya's chest trembled, hundreds of voices rose together outside, simultaneously the rapid footsteps of hundreds of people were heard in the sky along with various shouts from different voices. Udayaditya realized that there was a fire somewhere near the palace. For a long time the noise continued--his mind became very impatient. Suddenly the door of his prison was opened. Someone entered his dark house--he was startled and asked, "Who is it?"

He replied, "I am Sitaram, you come out."

Udayaditya said, "Why?"

Sitaram said, "Prince, there is a fire in the prison, come out quickly." Balia grabbed him - almost carried him out of the prison.

After a long time, Udayaditya came to the open place today--suddenly he could see a lot of sky above his head, the wind seemed to expand his broad chest and embrace him. The eye barrier was opened from all around. On that dark night, under the gaze of countless stars in the sky, standing on the soft grass in the wide field, suddenly an immense indescribable joy arose in his mind. After being silent for a while in that joy, he asked Sitaram, "What shall I do, where shall I go?" Confined for a long time in a narrow place, Chalan did not return--today came into this wide field and helplessly asked Sitaram, "What shall I do? Where shall I go?"

Sitaram said, "Come, come with me."

Meanwhile, the fire is burning fiercely. In the evening some of the subjects came to make some offering to the chief officers. They were sitting together in the courtyard of the palace, they were the first to start the fireball. There was a long row of cottages near the prison for the guards to live in--that's where they kept all their furniture and clothes. On receiving the news of the fire, all the guards who could escape, those who could not, started flailing their arms and legs. Udayaditya also had two guards at his gate, but there was no need for strict guarding. Dastur said they were only guarding. For Udayaditya sat so quietly in his house that it was not felt that he would ever try to escape or that he would ever want to escape. Therefore his gatekeepers fled first. It took from night, the fire would not take - someone started to move things, someone started to pour water. He started wandering around without doing anything or anyone; After the fire was extinguished, they were the ones who got the most joy. While everyone was busy, a woman came running among them, she wanted to say something. But who listens to him? Some abused him, some pushed him, no one listened to him. The one who heard it said, "What is wrong with Yuvraj running away, you or what? He knows Dayal Singh. I can't go anywhere now that I have left my house." Saying that he went into the crowd. After being rebuffed again and again, the woman became very angry. He grabbed the one he found in front of him and said, "Poramukho, have you eaten your eyeballs? Don't you know that you serve the king? I will tell the king tomorrow and put a thorn on the ground, but I will let you go. The young prince escaped."

"Well done, what's wrong with you?" Balia beat him well. This person was one of those who set the house on fire. After being beaten, the image of that woman became very strong. Like an angry tigress her eyes blazed, her hair swelled; He started gritting his teeth, his face looked like a ghoul. A piece of wood was burning in front of him, he picked it up, his hand was burnt, but he did not drop it, he took the burning wood and ran behind him. Unable to catch anything, he threw the stick at him.

# Chapter 30

Sitaram took Yuvraj with him to the bank of the canal. There was a big boat moored there, both of them went and stood in front of that boat. Seeing them, a person came out of the boat quickly and said, "Dada, have you come?" Udayaditya was completely startled--that ever-familiar voice, the voice associated with the memories of childhood, with the joys and sorrows of youth, as close as happiness in the world, as much joy as there is, that voice is inseparable with him. One day, sitting in bed late at night in the prison, he suddenly woke up hearing the sound of a flute in his dream - that voice. Vasant Roy came and embraced him in surprise. Both eyes were full of steam. Both sat there on the grass. After a long time, Udayaditya said, "Grandfather." Vasant Roy said, "What a grandpa." Nothing else was said. Again, after a long time, Udayaditya looked around, looked at the sky, looked at Vasant Ray's face and said longingly, "Grandpa, today I got freedom, I got you, what is left of my happiness? How long will this moment last?" After some time, Sitaram raised his hands and said, "Yuvaraj, get into the boat."

Yuvraj was surprised and said, "Why, why in a boat?"

Sitaram said, "Or the guards will come again right now."

Surprised, Udayaditya asked Vasant Ray, "Grandfather, are we running away?"

Basanta Ray took Udayaditya's hand and said, "Yes, brother, I will steal you away. This stone-hearted land--they do not love you. You deer-child live in the kingdom of pain, I will hide you in the soul, there. Be safe." Balia pulled Udayaditya close to her chest as if she wanted to take him away from the harsh world and bind him in the realm of love.

Udayaditya thought for a long time and said, "No Grandfather, I cannot escape."

Vasant Roy said, "Why, grandfather, have you forgotten this old man?"

Udayaditya said, "I go--once I hold my father's feet and beg for alms, maybe he will agree to go to Raigarh."

Vasant Roy got up and said, "Dada, listen to me - don't go there, it's futile to try."

Udayaditya sighed and said, "Let's go. I'll go back to the prison."

Basant Roy pressed her hand and said, "How can I go? I will not let you go."

Udayaditya said, "Grandfather, why do you invoke danger with this misfortune. Is there any possibility of peace where I live?"

Basant Roy said, "Dada, the wife who became a prison for you. Will she spoil all the happiness of her life at this young age?" Basant Ray's eyes began to water.

Then Udayaditya hurriedly said, "But come on Grandfather." He looked at Sitaram and said, "Sitaram, I want to send three letters to the palace."

Sitaram said, "There is paper and pen in the boat, I am bringing it. Write quickly, there is not much time."

Udayaditya begged his father for forgiveness. He wrote to his mother, "Mother, you have never been happier with me in your womb. Rest assured, Mother--I am going to Grandfather, there I will be happy, I will be in love, you will have no reason to worry." He wrote to Viva, "Chirayushmatishu--what else can I write to you--may you be born happily--go to Swamigriha and get a happy family and forget all the sufferings." Udayaditya's eyes filled with tears. Sitaram sent that letter to the palace with the hand of a bearded man. Everyone was getting into the boat - at that time they saw someone coming towards them. Sitaram was startled and said, "Oh, that summoner is coming. Rukmini came nearer and nearer. Her hair was falling, her region was falling, her eyes like burning embers were emitting two fires-- her repeated desire, insatiable revenge-- Unsettled by the pangs of instinct, he sought to quench his wrath by tearing to pieces whomever he met. Where the guards were putting out the fire, he dashed again and again, impatient with rage, into the palace--again and again in vain to gain entry into the chamber of Pratapaditya. Attempted, the guards beat him and drive him away, distraught with pain. Like a tigress, he tries to pounce on Udayaditya. Sitaram steps in. Screaming, he pounces on Sitaram, clutching him desperately in both arms. Immediately Sitaram cried out, the bearded sailors hurriedly came and forcibly took Rukmini away. Just as a suicidal scorpion was stinging all over itself, he impatiently scratched his chest with his fingernails and tore his hair and shouted, "Nothing happened, nothing happened- - Here I am dead, the sin of this woman-killing will be yours." In that dark night, this curse sounded from side to side. In a moment, Rukmini jumped into the water in an electric shock. The water in the canal was very high during the monsoons - where he sank there was no place. Blood was falling from Sitaram's shoulder, the sheet was soaked in water and tied on his shoulder. Going closer, he saw that sweat had appeared on Udayaditya's forehead, his hands and feet had become cold, he had almost fainted - Vasant Ray was also disorientated and surprised. The guards caught both of them and took them to the boat and immediately left the boat. Sitaram was frightened and said, "What a mishap during the journey."

# Chapter 31

When Udayaditya's boat crossed the canal and reached the river, Sitaram got off the boat and returned to the city. When he arrived, he asked for his sword from the prince.

Udayaditya's three letters were sent to Sitaram Palace by the hand of a man, but he had secretly specially forbidden him to hand over those letters to anyone. Coming back to the palace from the boat, Sitaram took the letter back somewhere. He kept only the letters of Mahishi and Beaver and destroyed the rest of the letters.

Then the fire has spread further. At night many people have gathered to get out of bed and watch the joke. It disturbs Nirvana and does not help the book.

It goes without saying that Sitaram had a hand in this fire. He did this feat with the help of some subjects and palace servants who were addicted to Udayaditya. In the evening five or six houses caught fire for no reason, this is never the work of God, even after trying so hard to put out the fire, there is a reason for it. Among those who have joined in extinguishing the fire, there are two each of Sitaram's people. Where there is no fire, they pour water, they do not go to fetch water, they break the pitcher by trick, it falls on his neck in a mess. The fire will not take anymore.

Meanwhile, while this commotion was going on, Sitaram's men set Udayaditya's empty prison on fire. One by one, windows, doors, frames, wooden fences etc. caught fire. Any source that could catch fire in that prison is invisible to everyone's dreams, so no one paid attention to it. Sitaram came back and saw that the fire had taken hold. Some bones, skulls and Udayaditya's sword were somehow thrown into Udayaditya's house by Sitaram.

Meanwhile, those who were putting out the fire in the guardhouse suddenly heard a scream from the direction of the prison. Everyone was shocked and said in unison, "What the hell." Someone came running and said, "Hey, the Prince's house is on fire." The blood of the guards turned to water, the benevolent lion's head turned. The pitcher fell from his hand, and the contents fell to the ground. At that time, another person came running from that direction and said, "Yuvaraj was heard shouting from inside the prison." Before he could finish his speech, Sitaram came running and said, "Hey, come quickly. The roof of the prince's house has fallen, and he cannot be answered." Everyone rushed towards the prince's prison. Gia found the house in ruins--fire all around--no way to enter the house. Then they stood there and blamed each other. By whose carelessness this incident happened, everyone was inclined to decide. A fierce dispute broke out, each started abusing each other. In fact, there was a fight.

Sitaram thought that Yuvraj has died in a house fire, he will be able to rest assured for a while after reporting this news. When he saw that the house was on fire, he tied a sheet on his head and happily walked towards his cottage. He came far from the palace. It was late at night, there were no people on the road, everything was quiet. The leaves of the bamboo trees are falling and the south wind is blowing occasionally, Sitaram's loving soul is exhilarated, he is singing a melodious song. The lonely Panth walked along that desolate road, singing with joy. After going some distance, a thought appeared in his mind. He thought that the whole family would have to flee from Jessohar, so let's save some money without effort. Mangala Poramukhi is dead, Balai is gone, let us go to his home once. Betty has a lot of money, there is no one in her family, if I don't take that money, someone else will take it. Let's try it. Thinking like this, Sitaram walked towards Rukmini's house, sang again with a cheerful heart. On the way, he saw an Abhisarini. Sitaram's eyes cannot avoid all this. An inevitable impulse arose in his mind to crack a couple of jokes--but as there was no time, he suppressed the impulse and went on.

Sitaram went near Rukmini's cottage and saw that the door was open. Heartily entered the cottage and looked around once. Deeper darkness--nothing can be seen. Looked around once. He tripped over a chest and fell, hitting his head twice on the wall. Sitaram's face began to tremble. It seemed that someone was in the house. As if someone's breathing is being heard -- he slowly went to the next room. Gia saw light coming from Rukmini's bedroom. Sitaram was very happy thinking that the lamp was still burning. He quickly went to that room. And who! Who is sitting at home! Who and Ramani are sitting quietly and trembling! The half-covered body is covered with wet clothes, water is dripping through the hair. His teeth are chattering with trembling. Only one lamp is burning in the room. The faint light of the lamp fell on her swarthy face, behind her a huge shadow of the woman fell on the wall--there was nothing else in the room--only that swarthy face, that long shadow, and a great silence. Sitaram's body froze as soon as he entered the room. I saw that Mangala was sitting in the dim light, with her hair and wet clothes. Seeing her immediately, she felt like a lover. Sitaram did not have the courage to advance - he could not even turn back with confidence. Sitaram was not at all timid, standing still for a moment before finally saying with a kind of outward courage and verbal mockery, "Where are you from, Magi. Are you not dead?" Rukmini frowned and looked at Sitaram's face for a while - then Sitaram's soul came to her voice and began to hum. Finally, Rukmini suddenly said, "That's it. You are not doomed yet, and I will die!" He stood up and waved his hand and said, "I have come back from Yama's door. First, I will put you and Yuvraj to sleep in the oven, take two handfuls of ashes from your oven and smear them on your body, then I will perform Yama's sadh. Before that, I have no place in Yamala."

Hearing Rukmini's voice, Sitaram became very brave. He immediately showed great affection and tried to get along with Rukmini. He didn't come too close, he came relatively close and said in a soft voice, "Mairi brother, that's why you are angry. I don't understand what you feel like. Tell me, Mangala, what have I done to you. Why are you so unhappy with your subordinates?" ? Do you understand brother? I will sing that song?"

The more Sitaram feigned affection, the more Rukmini began to swell. His head started to burn with anger - if Sitaram were the hair of his own head, he would have torn it off with both hands. If Sitaram were his own eyes, he would have plucked them out with his nails and broken them with his feet. He looked around and found nothing. He gritted his teeth and said, "Roso a little; I'm going to shave your head." Ballya went to the next room in search of the bundle, trembling. After a while, Sitaram tied a sheet around his neck and offered to die in a metaphorical way, but seeing Rukmini's face, his metaphor changed and he realized that he was not yet ready to die from the blows of Satyakara's stick, so he immediately retreated outside the cottage. Rukmini came to the empty house with her left hand and repeatedly hit Sitaram on the floor of the house.

Rukmini is now desperate. By the behavior of the Prince his anger was completely broken--all his means and all his purposes were utterly destroyed. Now Rukmini no longer has that sharp smile, no more electric sarcasm, she does not have the flowing wave-excitement of Janhvi of that warm month - all the servants of the palace who came to her, quarreled with them and separated them by insulting them. Dewanji's eldest son came to play a joke with him that day in Pan Chibai, Rukmini chased him away. Now no one can approach him. Everyone in the neighborhood is afraid of him.

Sitaram came out of the cottage and thought that the story of the escape of the Mangala Prince was all known; Therefore, everything will be revealed by this. Why didn't I come to kill the destroyer by strangling him? In any case, it is not good for me to stay in Jessohar any longer. I run away now. That night, Sitaram and his family left Jessohar and fled to Raigarh.

In the last night, the clouds started raining in torrents, the fire gradually went out, the news of the prince's death reached Pratapaditya's ears. Hearing this Pratapaditya immediately came outside to his residence and sat down. The guards were called, the minister came, and a couple of councilors came. One testified that he saw Yuvraj through the window while the fire was burning. And some people said, they could hear the cry of Yuvraj. Another brought from the Prince's house the remnants of his molten burnt sword. Pratapaditya asked, "Where is the foot?" Rajbati searched and did not find him. "He was also in prison when the fire broke out," someone said. Someone said, "No, he got the news at night that Yuvraj had died in a house fire and he immediately left Jessore after hearing it." When Pratapaditya was sitting in the meeting and listening to everyone's testimony, a noise arose at the door. A woman wants to enter the house, but the guards prevent her. Hearing this, Pratapaditya ordered him to be brought home. A guard brought Rukmini with him. The king asked him, "What do you want?" He waved his hand and said aloud, "I want nothing more--those guards of yours, every one of them for six months rotting and feeding on sticks, that's what I want to see. Do they obey you, or fear you!" Hearing this, the guards came round from all around. Rukmini turned back and rolled her eyes and said with a sharp rebuke, "Shut up, Minsera. Yesterday, when I grabbed you by the hands and feet and told you, oh your prince is running away with the old king of your Raigarh, did you poor people listen to my words? King. Work at home, you have become too proud, you have seen the five legs of the snake!

Pratapaditya said, "Tell me everything that happened."

Rukmini said, "What else can I say. Your young prince ran away with the old king last night!"

Pratapaditya asked, "Do you know who set fire to the house?"

Rukmini said, "I don't know anymore! That is your Sitaram. With your prince who is his greatest friend, and no one is his, Sitaram is his everything. All this is the work of that Sitaram. The old king, Sitaram and your prince, these three Millia did this after consultation, I told you clearly."

Pratapaditya was stunned for a long time. He asked, "How did you know all this?" Rukmini said, "What is the point of that talk! Give people with me, I myself will go and find them and get them out. The servants of your palace are all sheep, they will not do this."

Pratapaditya ordered people to accompany Rukmini and prescribed due punishment to the guards. One by one the hall became empty. Only the minister and the king remained. The minister thought that His Majesty would tell him something. But Pratapaditya didn't say anything, he sat dumbfounded. "Maharaj," said the minister very slowly, intent on what to say. Maharaj did not answer him. The minister got up slowly.

That same day, before evening, Pratapaditya received the news of Udayaditya's escape from a jailer. Udayaditya was going across the river in a boat, he saw him. Gradually, he started getting news from other people. The people who went with Rukmini came back after a week and said, I came to see Yuvraj in Raigarh. The king asked, "Where is that woman?" They said, "He did not come back, he stayed there."

Then Pratapaditya called one of his Pathan commanders named Muktiyar Khan and secretly ordered him. He saluted and left.

# Chapter 32

Even before Pratapaditya, Mahishi and Viva got to know the news of Udayaditya's escape. Both of them were overwhelmed with fear and thought that when Maharaj comes to know, then they don't know what to do. Every day when Maharaj received news one after the other, both their lives became more anxious with fear. Weeks went by in this way, until finally Maharaj got reliable news. But he did nothing. He did not show a hint of anger. Mahishi could no longer remain in doubt and once went to Pratapaditya. But for a long time he did not dare to ask anything about Udayaditya. Maharaj also did not raise anything about it. Finally unable to stay any longer, Mahishi said, "Maharaj, give me one alms, now measure Udaya. If you hurt the child any more, I will die of poison."

Pratapaditya Isha said angrily, "Before you sat down to cry! I have done nothing."

Lest Pratapaditya suddenly bow down again, the buffalo dared not raise the matter a second time. He came slowly in fear. One day, two days, three days passed, no change of mind was noticed by Maharaj. Seeing that, Mahishi and Viva were reassured. He thought that Maharaj was satisfied with Udayaditya's transfer.

Now for a few days Mahishi was able to relax.

Earlier, Mahishi had told Vivah and made a state at home that Ramchandra Roy had written a letter requesting Vivah to send him to his in-laws' home. Beaver is no longer happy. There was no peace in Viva's mind for a moment until Rammohan was sent away. Whenever he retired, he thought, "What is he thinking? Has he understood my situation correctly? Maybe he is angry. If I explain to him, won't he measure me? Oh Jagadishwar, when will I explain? When will we meet again?" Vibha was constantly thinking about this. Divanishi had pressed a fear in her mind. Hearing the buffalo's words, Viva felt immense joy, what a terrible weight was instantly removed from her mind. Dismissing her shame and shame, she laughed and cried with her face on her mother's chest. How long did Lukaia remain silent. Her mother began to weep. When Viva felt that her husband had not misunderstood her, that he had understood her heart - then the whole world became beautiful in her eyes. How wide her husband's heart seemed! Her husband's love! How much faith, how much trust was born in her! She thought that her husband's love was her unshakable refuge in this world. She was entwined with her arms like a tiny vine like a small vine in the huge arms of a strong great man and depended fearlessly with infinite faith, nothing would separate her from that trust. . Viva became cheerful. Her soul expanded, serene like the cloudless autumn sky. How she now plays like a boy with her brother Samraditya. How she pleads with her mother like a loving little girl, helps her with the housework. What had been before him like a speechless silent gloomy shadow, has vanished--now his cheerful heart has blossomed in all his parts like the clear dawn. The shyness, the shyness, the sadness, the pride, the silent expression as before are no more; He now happily talks with his mother so much that before he would have been ashamed to say it, he didn't want to. Seeing this joy of the daughter, the infinite love of the mother was lifted up. A thought has arisen inside his mind, but he has never expressed that thought even in a glimpse to Biva. After becoming a mother, in which life will you tarnish the beautiful and peaceful smile of Beaver. That's why the girl walks around smiling and playing in front of her eyes every day, the mother looks at it with a smiling face and unsatisfied eyes.

There was a fear, a doubt present in Mahishi's mind, that's why he couldn't take Viva and send her to her in-laws house until today. A couple of weeks went by, everyone was pretty sure about Udayaditya. Just what to do about the beaver, the buffalo still can't decide. A few more days passed. The longer the delay, the more impatience the beaver grew. Viva feels that the more the delay, the more she is becoming a criminal towards her husband. When He has called, why delay? Once he forgave, again-- For some days Viva said nothing more, finally one day she could not stay any longer; Going to her mother, holding her neck and looking at her face, Viva said, "Mom." His mother could understand everything in that word, pulled Vivah to her chest and said, "What a choice." Viva remained silent for a long time and finally said, "Mother, when will you send me?" Beaver's face and ears turned red as she wrinkled. Mother asked with a smile, "Where will I send Vibhu?" Viva pleaded, "Don't say it, mother." Mahishi said, "Say it for a few more days, son. I will send it soon." Tears came to his eyes.

# Chapter 33

After many days, Udayaditya came to Raigarh, but he did not enjoy as much as before. There was a thought in my mind, so nothing felt good. He thought that what Grandpa had done, what would happen to him had no place, and it was not felt that his father would give him relief easily. How soon I was born. He went to Basant Roy and said, "Grandpa, I'm going, let's go back to Jessohar." he sang,

What else will I leave you?

I did not mind with my mind or I got it

I will keep it by force.

If you steal your heart-full soul

You stay there

Fills the empty heart.

Finally, after Udayaditya said it again and again, Basant Roy's heart was hurt, he stopped singing and said with a sad face, "Why, Dada, if I am near, what is your pain?" Udayaditya could not say anything else.

Seeing Udayaditya in awe, Basant Roy tried hard day and night to make him happy. He used to play the sitar, sing songs, take him around with him, his reign almost stopped because of Udayaditya. Basanta Ray's fear that he could not keep Udayaditya, lest Udayaditya go back to Jessohar. Day and night he kept his eyes on him, saying to him, "Grandfather, I will not let you go to that stone-hearted country."

As the days went by, Udayaditya's mind relaxed a lot. Having gained freedom after a long time, the narrow-span rocky four are freed from their imprisonment and live in the tender heart of Vasant Ray in his infinite love. After many days one sees the trees all around, sees the sky, sees the light of open dawn on the horizon, hears the song of the birds, the wind howls from the distant horizon, and at night sees all the stars in the sky, drowns in the stream of Jyotsna, exists in the soul of sleeping stillness. keep doing You can go wherever you want, do whatever you want, there are no obstacles. All the people who knew Udayaditya in his childhood came from far and wide to see Udayaditya. Gangadhar came, Phatik came, Habichacha and Karimullah came, Mathur came with his three sons, Paran and Hari two brothers came, Shital Sardar came with five sticks to show his game. People started coming to the prince every day. Yuvraj asked them many things. The subjects were very happy and surprised to see that Udayaditya had not yet forgotten them. Mathur said, "Maharaj, in the month in which you came to Raigad, this son was born to me, you went to see me, after that I had two more children born to me with your blessings". So he brought his three sons to the Prince and said, "Bow down." They prostrated themselves. Paran came and said, "When going to Jessore from here, I was the sailor in that boat, my lord." Shital Sardar came and said, "Maharaj, when you were in Raigad, you saw my stick game and gave me bakshish. Today I want to show my boys' game to Maharaj. Come on, Bapadhan, you go ahead." Baliya called the boys. Every morning like this, people would come to Udayaditya in groups and talk together.

Being in such affection, in the trees, in the joy, in the joy of singing, naturally the thought came from Udayaditya's mind very relaxed. He closed his eyes and thought that maybe his father was not angry, maybe he was satisfied, otherwise he would not have done anything else for so long.

But he could not keep his mind in such blind faith for long. What a fear he felt for his grandfather. It is in vain to tell grandfather to return to Jessohar; He decided to hide and escape to Jessohar one day. I remembered that prison again. Where is this joyous freedom and where is the monotonous life of that narrow little prison. That moment in prison seemed like a year. The lightless, lonely, airless, closed room was clearly seen in the imagination, the body shuddered. However, he decided that one day he would have to run away from here towards that prison. He could not remember such a thing today. One day I will run away - he felt very relaxed.

Today is Thursday, Barbella, the journey cannot take place today, it will happen tomorrow. Today is a bad day. It has been raining continuously since morning. The whole sky is covered with clouds. Udayaditya has decided to leave Raigarh this evening. When he met Basant Roy in the morning, Basant Roy held Udayaditya and said, "Dada, I had a big nightmare last night. I don't remember the dream well, I just remember, you are parting with me like a birth."

Udayaditya held Vasant Ray's hand and said, "No, grandpa. Why should divorce be like birth?"

Vasant Roy on the other hand said thoughtfully, "If not that, what else? Tell me how long I will live, I am old."

The final strains of last night's nightmare were still reverberating in the cavern of Vasant Roy's mind, so what was he thinking out of his mind.

Udayaditya remained silent for a while and said, "Grandfather, what will happen if we part again."

Vasant Roy grabbed Udayaditya's throat and said, "Why, brother, why should we divorce? Don't leave me. Don't leave me at this old age, brother!"

Tears came to Udayaditya's eyes. He was surprised, as if Basant Roy had sensed the aspiration of his mind. Sighing, he said, "If I am near, you will be in danger, grandfather."

Basant Roy laughed and said, "What is the danger, brother? At this age, do I fear any more danger. Death is no longer a danger. Death is my neighbor. He always sends me to take my teachings, I do not fear him. He who overcomes all the dangers of life. Kariya can live to old age, but his boat sank when he came to the shore!"

Udayaditya stayed with Vasant Roy all day. It started to rain all day.

In the afternoon the rain stopped, Udayaditya got up. Vasant Roy said, "Dada, where are you going?"

Udayaditya said, "Let's go for a walk."

Vasant Roy said, "I didn't go today."

Udayaditya said, "Why grandfather?"

Vasant Roy held Udayaditya and said, "Today you do not leave the house, today you stay with me brother!"

Udayaditya said, "I will not go far, grandfather, I will come back now." He said and went out.

As he went to the palace gate, a guard said, "Maharaj, shall I go with you?"

"No, not necessarily," said the Prince.

The guard said, "Your majesty has no weapon!"

Yuvraj said, "What is the need for weapons?"

Udayaditya went outside the palace. There is a long wide field, he went into that field. He started walking alone. Gradually the light of day began to come. How many thoughts came to mind. Yuvraj started thinking about his aimless life. He thought and saw that nothing is stable, he has no status anywhere - he has no address for what will happen in the next moment. Age is young, there is still a lot of life left, without building a house anywhere, without finding a permanent shelter, how will this far-reaching future be spent like this? After that, I remembered - Biva. Where is Viva now? For so long I was hiding the sun of his happiness, now is he happy? How much he blessed Viva in his heart.

In the field there is a forest of ashtha, date palm, betel nut, etc., for the shepherds to sit in the sun--the prince went into it. It was evening. has darkened Yuvraj was supposed to escape today - with that determination he was agitating in his heart. When Basant Roy hears that Udayaditya has run away, what will happen to him, then he will be heartbroken and say with a pitiful face, "Ah, Dada has run away from me!" He could see that picture clearly.

At that moment a woman called out in a hoarse voice, "Sing here, here is your prince--here!"

Two soldiers came and stood near the Prince with torches in their hands. Soon many others came and surrounded him. Then the lady came to him and said, "Do you know me? Look here! Look here!" Yuvraj saw Rukmini in the light of the torch. The soldiers saw Rukmini's behavior and scolded her saying, "Go away Magi." Without even paying attention, he began to say, "Who did this? I did it. Who did this? I did it. Who brought these soldiers here? I brought them. I did this for you, and you--." Yuvraj turned back towards Rukmini in disgust. The soldiers forcibly caught Rukmini and separated her. Then Muktia came in front of Khan and saluted Yuvraj and stood. Yuvraj was surprised and said, "Muktiyar Khan, what's up?"

Muktiyar Khan humbly said, "Sir, I have come with orders from our majesty."

"What orders," asked the prince.

Muktia Khan took out the order signed by Pratapaditya and gave it to the Prince.

Yuvraj read and said, "What is the need for so many soldiers for this? If you had written me a letter and ordered me, I would have gone. I had decided that you were the one who would go, and I would go. But what is the need for further delay? Let's go now. Let's go back to Jessohar now." Muktia Khan folded her hands and said, "I can't return now." Yuvraj got scared and said, "Why?" Muktia Khan said, "There is one more order, I cannot go without fulfilling it."

Yuvraj said in a frightened voice, "What an order!"

Muktia Khan said, "The Maharaja has ordered the death penalty for the Raja of Raigarh."

Yuvraj was startled and said loudly, "No, you didn't, you lied."

Muktiyar Khan said, "Your Majesty, it is not a lie. I have a letter signed by your Majesty."

Yuvraj took hold of the commander's hand and said in dismay, "Muktiyar Khan, you have misunderstood. Maharaj has ordered that if you do not get Udayaditya, then Basant Ray--what else when I am capturing you! Take me now, take me now- "Take me captive, and delay no more."

Muktiyar Khan said, "Prince, I have not misunderstood. Maharaja has given a clear order."

Yuvraj became impatient and said, "You must have misunderstood! His intention is not like that. Come on, go to Jessohar. I will explain to you in front of Maharaj, if he orders a second time, then complete the order."

Muktia said with folded hands, "Prince, forgive me, I can't do it." Yuvraj became more impatient and said, "Muktiyar, remember, I will get the throne one day? Keep my word, satisfy me."

Muktia stood unanswered.

Yuvraj's face turned pale, sweat spots appeared on his forehead. He held the commander's hand firmly and said, "Muktiyar Khan, you will not have a place in hell if you kill the old innocent soul."

Muktiyar Khan said, "There is no sin in obeying the orders of the master."

Udayaditya said in a loud voice, "False words. The scriptures that say that, the scriptures are false. Surely, Muktiyar, you should know that sin is sin if you follow the commandments."

Muktia stood unanswered.

Udayaditya looked around and said, "But let me go. I will go back to the formation. Take your army and go thither, I call you to battle. Win the battlefield there and then do your bidding."

Muktia stood unanswered. The soldiers came further and surrounded the Prince. Seeing no way out, Yuvraj cried out in the darkness, "Grandfather, be careful." The forest trembled, and he went to the edge of the field and joined the tune. The soldiers came and captured Udayaditya. Udayaditya shouted once more, "Grandfather, be careful." A passer-by was passing through the field--Hearing the sound, came near and said, "Who sings." Udayaditya hastily said, "Go, escape, warn the king." Soon the passerby was arrested by the soldiers. Whoever was passing through the field, the soldiers immediately captured him.

A few soldiers kept Udayaditya captive, Muktiyar Khan and the rest of the soldiers left the soldier's garb and hid their weapons and went towards Garh in plain clothes. Raigarh had more than a hundred gates, through different gates they entered the Garh.

Then in the evening Basant Ray used to sit and sigh. On the other hand, in the Thakurghar of the Rajbari, the conch bell is ringing for the evening puja. There is no noise in the big palace, it is quiet all around. As per the rules of Vasant Roy, most of the servants got some time off in the evening.

Vasant Ray suddenly saw that Muktiyar Khan had entered his room. Busy, he said, "Sir, don't enter this room. I am coming right away."

Muktiyar Khan went outside the room and stood near the door. Basant Roy finished the conversation and quickly came out and put his hand on Muktia's neck and asked, "Sir, how are you?"

Muktia saluted and said briefly, "Yes, Your Majesty."

Vasant Roy said, "Are you done?"

Muktiyar command yes

Vasant Roy. "I will arrange for you to stay here today."

Muktia said, "No order, no need. We have to go now after finishing the work."

Vasant Roy. No, that will not happen, sir, I will not leave you today, I will have to stay here today.

Muktiyar No, my lord, I must go soon.

Vasant Roy asked, "Why do you tell me? Do you have a special job? Pratap is fine?"

Muktiyar Your Majesty is fine.

Vasant Roy. But what is your business, tell me quickly. Concerned about hearing special urgency. Pratap did not have any danger?

Muktiyar No, he was not in any danger. I have come to fulfill an order of the Maharaja.

Vasant Roy quickly asked, "What order? Tell me now."

Muktia Khan issued an order and handed it to Vasant Roy. Vasant Roy took it to the light and started reading. Meanwhile, one by one, all the soldiers came to the door and surrounded it.

After reading, Vasant Roy slowly came to Muktiyar Khan and asked, "Is this written by Pratap?"

Muktia said, "Yes."

Vasant Roy asked again, "Khan Saheb, is this Pratap's handwriting?"

Muktia said, "Yes, Your Majesty."

Then Basant Roy cried and said, "Khan Saheb, I made Pratap a man with my own hands."

He remained silent for a while, finally he said again, "When Pratap was so small, I used to hold him in my arms day and night, he did not want to leave me for a moment. That Pratap grew up, I gave him in marriage, I placed him on the throne, I took his children in my arms-- this Pratap has written this article with his own hand, sir?"

Muktia's dark eyelids got wet, she stood silently in dismay.

Vasant Roy asked, "Where is Dada? Where is Uday?"

Muktiyar Khan said, "He has been captured. He has been sent to the King for trial."

Vasant Roy said, "Uday is imprisoned? Khan Saheb is imprisoned? Shall I not see him once?"

Muktia Khan raised his hands and said, "No sir, there is no order."

Vasant Roy held Muktia's hand in his eyes and said, "Khan Saheb, don't let me see you once!"

Muktia said, "I am only a servant of the commanding officer."

Basant Roy took a deep breath and said, "There is no mercy in this world, come sir, obey your orders."

Muktiyar then touched the ground and saluted and said, "Maharaj, forgive me - I am only following the Lord's order, I have no fault."

Vasant Roy said, "No sir, what is your fault? You have no fault. Shall I pardon you?" Balia went to Muktia Khan and hugged him and said, "Tell Pratap, I died blessing him. And look, Khan Sahib, I passed the burden of Uday on you at the time of my death. He is innocent - see that he does not suffer any more due to unfair trial. "

Saying this, Vasant Ray closed his eyes and bowed down to the God, started chanting the mala in his right hand and said, "Saheb this time."

Muktiyar Khan called, "Abdul." Abdul Mukt came with sword in hand. Muktia's face turned away. Moments later Abdul came out of the house with bloody hands. The house started bleeding.

# Chapter 34

Muktiyar Khan came back. Leaving most of the troops at Raigarh, he took Udayaditya and immediately marched to Jessohar. For two days on the way, Udayaditya did not touch food, did not speak a word to anyone, but kept silent and thought. Still as a stone image--no sleep, no blink, no tears, no sight in his eyes--only thought. He got into the boat, raised his face from the boat and kept looking at the water, the boat started moving--he started hearing the sound of the waves, the sound of the water entered his ears. Yet he heard nothing, saw nothing, only began to think. The night came, the stars rose in the sky, the sailors tied the boat, everyone slept in the boat. Only the sound of water could be heard, the small waves crashing against the boat--the Prince gazed ahead at the far-reaching stretch of white sand and began to think. In the morning the sailors woke up, opened the boat, the morning wind came out, the east became cloudy, the prince began to think. On the third day, Yuvraj's two eyes began to overflow with tears - He kept his head on his hands and kept looking at the water, and kept looking at the sky. The boat began to move -- the trees on the shore began to pass over the eyes like clouds, tears began to fall from the eyes in a thousand streams. After a long time, Mukti came to Yuvraj with a sad heart and humbly asked, "Yuvaraj, what do you think?" Yuvraj was startled, and for a long time he gazed at Muktiyar's face in stunned astonishment. Seeing the expression of compassion on the face of Muktiyar, Yuvraj immediately opened his closed soul and said, "I wonder what I did when I was born in the world. What a disaster has become for me. O God, why are those who are weak born in this world? Those who cannot stand in the world on their own, those who What good do they do to the world, by entangling others? Whom they seize, they sink, hinder all the works of the world--not even themselves able to stand, and-burdening all. I am a weak coward, God saved me, and those who were the joy of the world. , was the hope of the world--He destroyed them for me. And no, I departed from this world."

Udayaditya was brought captive before Pratapaditya. Pratapaditya took him to the inner room and closed the door. As soon as Pratapaditya approached, Udayaditya's body shuddered, his entire body shriveled with inevitable hatred - he could no longer look at his father's face.

Pratapaditya said in a serious tone, "Which punishment suits you?"

Udayaditya said steadily, "Whatever you command."

Pratapaditya said, "You are not worthy of this kingdom of mine."

Udayaditya said, "No, O king, I am not worthy. I do not want your kingdom. Release me from your throne, this beg."

Pratapaditya also wants that, he said, "How can I know that what you are saying is the truth of your heart?"

Udayaditya said, "I was born with weakness, but till today I have never told a lie for my own benefit. If you don't believe me, today I will touch the feet of Mother Kali and swear - I will never rule even a single piece of land in your kingdom. Samraditya is yours. heir to the kingdom."

Satisfied, Pratapaditya said, "What do you want?"

Udayaditya said, "My lord, I want nothing more, just don't keep me caged like a caged animal. Abandon me, I will go to Kashi now. One more alms--give me some money. I will have a guest house there in the name of Dadamahasaya and will establish a temple.”

Pratapaditya said, "Well, I admit that."

On that day, Udayaditya went to the temple and swore in front of Pratapaditya, "Mother Kali, you are a witness, I swear by touching your feet - as long as I live, I will not take even a mole of the kingdom of the king of Jashohar as my sacrifice. I will not sit on Jashohar's throne, Jashohar's I will not even touch the scepter. If I ever do, the sin of killing this grandpa shall be mine." She said and got up.

When Maharani heard that Udayaditya was leaving Kashi, she came to Udayaditya and said, "Baba Udaya, take me with you."

Udayaditya said, "What is that, mother. You have Samraditya, all your family stayed here, if you leave here, there will be no Rajalakshmi in Jessore."

Mahishi cried and said, "Son, if you have left the world at this age, in what life will I have taken the world? You will have left the kingdom and the world and become a monk. Who will see you there? I cannot leave you because your father is Pashan." Mahishi loved Udayaditya the most out of all his children, he wept bitterly for Udayaditya.

Udayaditya held his mother's hand and said with tears in his eyes, "Mother, you know that if I stay in the palace, there will be cause for fear in my step. Rest assured, mother, I will be safe by going to the feet of Visveshwar."

Udayaditya went to Viva and said, "Viva, my sister, I will make you happy before going to Kashi. I myself will take you to your in-laws' house, this is my only solution."

Viva asked Udayaditya, "How is Grandfather?"

"Grandpa is fine." Saying that, Udayaditya hurried away from there.

# Chapter 35

Udayaditya and Biva started to travel. Viva held her mother's neck and cried. Where they were in Anthapura, before going to the in-laws' house, everyone began to give various kinds of good advice to Viva.

Mahishi once sent for Udayaditya, saying, "Father, you are taking Vivaka away if they are careless."

Udayaditya was startled and said, "Why mother, why should they be careless?"

Mahishi said, "What if they are angry with Viva."

Udayaditya said, "No mother, Biva's children, can they ever be angry with Biva?"

The buffalo wept and said, "Take it carefully, my son, if they disobey, Bibha will not survive."

A fear arose in Udayaditya's mind. It never occurred to him before that his wife could be disrespected by her in-laws. Udayaditya had thought that all his karma had ended, but he saw that it was not over yet. He has sheltered Biva, who knows what is in Biva's eyes as a result.

During the journey, Udayaditya and Viva came and bowed to the mother. Lest the journey be interrupted, the buffalo did not cry, but as soon as they left, he fell on the ground and began to cry. Udayaditya and Vivah came after bowing to their father, bowed to the other elders of the house. Udayaditya took Samraditya in his arms and kissed him and said to you, "Son, let not the curse of the throne on which you sit touch you." The royal servants loved Udayaditya very much, they came one by one and bowed down to him, all started crying. Finally, both went to the temple and bowed to the deity and set off.

The arena of grief, peril, torture lay behind--the prison of life lay behind. Udayaditya thought that he would not enter this life again in this house. He looked back once. He saw the bloodthirsty and hard-hearted Rajbati standing like a giant with his head raised in the sky. Behind intrigues, arbitrariness, bloodlust, the suffering of the weak, the tears of the helpless, in front eternal freedom, the unblemished beauty of nature, the natural affection of the heart stretched out both arms to embrace him. It was just dawn. From the forest on the east side of the river, six high beams of rays have risen. A golden glow fell over the trees. People are waking up. The sailors raised the sails and opened the boat while singing happily. Udayaditya's soul rose up to sing the song of freedom with the birds after seeing this serene and holy dawn of nature. He said in his mind, "May I be born to roam freely in the vast greenness of nature, and live together with simple creatures."

The boat left. Hearing the songs of the sailors and the lapping of the water, both advanced. Biva's calm heart was filled with joy, Arun's eyes shone on his face. It was as if he had woken up from a nightmare after such a long time and was reassured to see the face of the world. The division is going. Who is going to? Who is calling him? Eternal immovable love has called her--viva will be winged like little birds and hide comfortably in the faithful heart within that layer of tender love. Around the world today he can see the ocean of love. Udayaditya called Vivah and told him many stories in a voice as soft as the sound of water. Beaver liked what he heard.

The boat entered the kingdom of Ramachandra Raya. Looking around, an unprecedented joy arose in Beaver's mind. What a beautiful decoration. Seeing the cottages, seeing the people, Beaver thought that everyone was happy. Biva was willing, called the subjects and asked them once about their king. Seeing the people, a kind of wonderful love arose in his heart. He liked everyone he saw. Sometimes one or two poor people were seen; Biva said to herself, "Ah, why is he in such a state? I will go to Anthapura and send for him. I will do whatever will relieve his sorrow." Everyone seemed to belong to him. The misery and poverty that exists in this state is not easy for him. Biva began to wish, the subjects came to her once and called her mother, offered her their own sorrows to her and she removed that sorrow.

Udayaditya set up a boat in a village near the capital. He has decided to send a message of their arrival to the palace and they will welcome them and take them away. By the time the boat was docked, it was late afternoon. Udayaditya thought that people would be sent tomorrow morning. Beaver's heart's desire was announced today.

# Chapter 36

People are very busy today. The music is playing all around. There is a festival in the village. This awakened eager joy in Biva's soul, after hearing the sound of music around her, her heart became excited. Lest Udayaditya was exposed to this excessive joy, he struggled to suppress his laughter. Udayaditya saw the festival on the banks of the river and went to the village to find out what was going on.

It's been a while. One asked from the shore, "Whose boat is it?" From the boat, the servants of the palace called out, "Who is that? Rammohan that? Hey, SS." Rammohan quickly entered the boat. Biva is sitting alone in the boat, seeing Rammohan, Harsha excitedly says, "Mohan."

Rammohan. mother

Rammohan Beaver looked at that smiling face full of simple joy for a long time and said faintly, "Mom, have you come?"

Biva quickly said, "Yes, Mohan. Has Maharaj got the news by now? Have you come to fetch me?"

Rammohan said, "No, mother, don't be so busy. Stay today, I will take another day."

Seeing Rammohan's expression, Viva suddenly got dirty and said, "Why Mohan, why don't I go today."

Ram Mohan said, "It's getting late today - stay today, mother."

Viva was very scared and said, "Tell me the truth, Mohan, what happened?"

Rammohan could not stay any longer. He has no habit of hiding. There he sat down, crying and said, "Mother Janani, today you have no place in your kingdom, you have no home in your royal palace. Today the king is getting married."

Beaver's face turned completely pink. His hands and feet were frozen. Rammohan began to say, "Mother, when this vile child of yours went to call you, then why did you not come, mother? Then why did you turn me back, mother, being a cruel stone? I had no more face to Maharaj. My chest was torn, yet that you I couldn't say a word!"

Viva could not see anything in her eyes, turned her head and fell there. Rammohan quickly brought water and sprinkled it on Beaver's face and eyes. After a while Viva sat up. Beaver's whole world was shattered in one blow. Coming into the kingdom of Swami, approaching the capital, coming to the gates of Rajpuri, all the hopes of happiness of the thirsty-hearted Biva met like a mirage.

Viva said eagerly, "Mohan, he who sent for me--is there much delay in my coming?"

Mohan said, "Is the book delayed?"

Biva said impatiently, "Why don't you forgive me?"

Mohan said, "Where did you forgive me?"

Viva said, "Mohan, I will go to see him only once." Balia cried under her breath.

Rammohan wiped his eyes and said, "Don't stay today, mother."

Viva said, "No Mohan, I will come to see him once today."

Rammohan said, "Yuvraj first come back from the village."

Viva said, "No Mohan, go now."

Biva thought that Udayaditya would not let him go for fear of humiliation when he heard this news.

Rammohan said, "But bring one Shivika."

Viva said, "Why Shivika? Am I the queen that Shivika wants. I will go like a little subject, like a beggar, what is my job in Shivika?"

Rammohan said, "I shall not see it as long as I live."

Viva said in a bitter voice, "Mohan, I fall at your feet, don't stop me, it's getting late."

Rammohan said with a broken heart, "Well mother, so be it."

Viva came out of the boat in the guise of a little woman. The servants of the boat came and said, "What is this mother, where are you going in this dress!"

Rammohan said, "This is mother's kingdom, you can go wherever you want."

The servants began to object, Rammohan divided them.

# Chapter 37

People all around, crowds all around. Earlier, Bibha would have died of shyness, today nothing is in her eyes. Everything you see seems like a lie. All around is a noisy dreamscape--nothingness. A crowd can be seen all around, a noise can be heard from all around, as if it has no meaning.

As soon as she reached the gate of Rajpuri through the crowd, a gatekeeper held Sasa Biva's hand and restrained her, then Sasa Biva fell into the outer world in an instant, saw all around, died of shame. Her veil was open, she quickly removed her head veil. Rammohan was going ahead, he turned back and stood staring at the door. Not far away was Fernandez, who seized Asia Dwari and ruled Bilkhan. Viva entered the palace. Viva entered the palace like other maidservants, but no one greeted her.

Only Raja and Rama were sitting in the house. Biva entered the house and fell on the ground at the king's feet looking at the king's face. The king stood up and asked, "Who are you? A beggar? Have you come to ask for alms?"

Biva raised her bowed face and looked at the king's face with tearful eyes and said, "No, my lord, I have come to donate all my wealth. I have come to leave you in the hands of others."

Rammohan could not stay, came near and said, "Maharaj, your mahisi-- the princess of Jessohar."

Suddenly Ramachandra Roy's life was shocked. But immediately Rama smiled and looked at the king and said in a harsh voice, "Why, don't you remember your grandfather now?"

Ramachandra Roy's heart was filled with compassion, but he laughed cruelly at Ramai's words. He thought, show mercy to Viva now, lest she be ridiculed.

A thousand thunderbolts struck Biva's head, and he died of shame. She closed her eyes and said to herself, Mother Go, Vasundhara, you are hesitant. He looked around, looking at Rammohan's face with a helpless look.

Rammohan came running and grabbed Ramai Bhand by his neck and took him out of the house.

The king got angry and said, "Rammohan, you insult me!"

Rammohan trembled and said, "Maharaj, I have insulted you. Your buffalo--my mother Thakrun was insulted--what has happened to him, I will wrap his head and throw him out of the city, but my name is Rammohan."

The king scolded Rammohan saying, "Who is my buffalo? I do not know him."

Biva's face turned blue, she covered her face, her entire body trembled, and finally she fainted and fell on the ground. Then Rammohan said to the king with raised hands, "Maharaj, today four of us have come to serve your family. We have been serving you since childhood. Today you insulted my mother Thakrun, removed your kingdom Lakshmi, today I also left your service. My mother- I will spend my life serving Thakur. I will eat by begging, but I will not step on the shadow of this palace." Balia bowed to Rammohan Raja and said to Viva, "Come, mother, come. Get out of here quickly. Don't stay here even for a moment." Balia grabbed Viva and brought her. There were many maidservants near the door, one of them picked up the unconscious Viva and came back to the boat.

Viva left Kashi with Udayaditya. There he continued to spend his life in meditation, service to God and the service of his brother. Rammohan was with them as long as he lived. Sitaram also came to Kashi with his family and took shelter of Udayaditya.

The market in Chandradwip in front of which Beaver's boat was anchored, still bears its name--

"Bouthakurani's Market."
