# Bhau-Thakurani's hat

## First paragraph.

It's late at night. summer time The wind has stopped. Even the leaves of the tree are not moving. Udayaditya, the prince of Yasahera, the eldest son of Pratapaditya, is seated on the bed of his bed-chamber. By his side is his wife Surma.

Surma said, “My dear, bear with me, bear with me. One day a happy day will come.”

Udayaditya said, “I desire no more happiness, I desire, if I were not born in a royal palace, if I were a prince, the smallest subject of the Yashaehara-lord, his eldest son, the only heir to his throne, all his riches, and the glory of his influence. I wouldn't be! If you do penance, all this past can be reversed."

Surma was very anxious and took Yuvraj's right hand in both hands and pressed it, and looked at his face and slowly took a long breath. You can give your life to fulfill the wish of the Prince, but even if you give your life, you will not be able to fulfill this wish, this is sad.

Yuvraj said, “Surma, I could not be happy just saying that I was born in the house of the king. Everyone in the king's house is born only as an heir, not as a child. My father has been testing me every moment since my childhood, whether I can maintain the honor he earned, whether I can brighten the face of the family, whether I can carry the weight of the kingdom or not. Every act, every gesture towards me is seen with the eyes of examination, not with the eyes of love. Relatives, ministers, Raj Sabhas, citizens are calculating my future by taking every word and deed into detail. All shook their heads and said - No, this dangerous kingdom will not be saved by me. I'm stupid, I don't understand anything. Everyone started neglecting me, father started hating me. I completely abandoned my hope. Don't even look!”

Surma's eyes watered. He said “A—ha! How could you!” He was sad, he was angry, he said "Those who thought you stupid are stupid!"

Udayaditya smiled, grabbed Surma's chin and shook his face. He became serious in a moment and said-

"No, Surma, the truth is, I have no knowledge of governance. He has been tested enough. When I was sixteen years old, Maharaj handed over the charge of Hasenkhali Pargana to me to teach me the work. Within six months, chaos ensued. The rent fell, the subjects began to bless; The workers began to complain against me to the king. Everyone in the Raj Sabha agreed that when the Prince became so beloved by the subjects, it was clear that he would never be able to rule the kingdom. Until then, Maharaj didn't look too much at me. He used to say that Kulangar will be just like Raigarh's Khura Basant Roy, playing the sitar and dancing and will bring down the kingdom.

Surma again said, “My dear, bear with me, bear with me. Be a thousand, the father is not. Today all his heart is filled with the only desire of kingdom-gaining, kingdom-growth, there, there is no room for love. As long as his hopes are fulfilled, the kingdom of his love dwells in the house.”

Yuvraj said “Surma, your intellect is sharp, perceptive, but this time you have misunderstood. Together, there is no end to hope; Secondly, the more the limit of the Father's kingdom dwells at home, the more he gains the kingdom, the more the fear of losing it dwells in his mind; The more serious the royal business becomes, the more you will find me unfit for it.”

Surma did not misunderstand, he just believed wrongly; Faith also violates reason. He hoped that this form should be.

“Unable to bear the carelessness or neglect anywhere around, I used to run away and go to Raigad to Dada Mahashay! Father did not seek much. Ah, what a change. I could see the trees there, I could go to the cottages of the villagers, I didn't have to wear formal clothes. Apart from that, Jan T, where Dadamahshay lives, cannot tolerate sad thoughts or harsh, seriousness in his trisima. Playing gahiya, amused and filled the surroundings. All around merriment, goodwill, whenever I went there, I would forget that I am the Prince of Yeshahr. He is a mistake of comfort! Finally when I was 18 years old, one day there was a spring breeze in Raigarh, green Kunjaban all around and in that spring I saw Rukmini.”

Surma said "I have heard that many times!"

Udayaditya, “Listen once more. Sometimes one word stings in the soul, if I don't let those words out, then how can I survive. I am ashamed to say that to you, it is painful, so I say it again and again, the day I will no longer be ashamed, it will not be painful, that day I will understand that my atonement is over, that day I will not say it again.

Surma, “What is atonement dear? If you have sinned, it is the sin's fault, not yours. i am Don't know you? Can't Antaryami see your mind?”

Udayaditya began to say, “Rukmini is three years older than me. She is a lonely widow. With the grace of Dada Mahashay, he was able to live in Raigarh. I don't remember what trick he used to attract me in the first place. Then the rays of noon burned in my mind. The light was so intense that I could not see anything clearly, the world around was covered in a luminous vapor. All the blood seemed to rise to the head; Nothing was surprising, nothing seemed impossible; The way, the way, the direction, all took a shape. I have never experienced this before, and I have never experienced this after this. Jagadishwar knows, to fulfill his purpose, he had agitated the whole world for one day against this small weak mindless heart, as if the universal behavior united and led this small heart of mine astray in an instant. A moment—no more than a momentary blow of all the outer world, and in a moment the root of a feeble heart was rent, and with lightning he fell, embracing the dust. When he got up after that, he was dusty, faded, he didn't wipe the dust off, he didn't show any dirt. What did I do, God, that in one moment you blackened all the whites of my life? If you turn the day into night? In the flower-forest of my heart, the faces of Malti and jasmine flowers turned black with shame!”

With every blow, Udayaditya's fair face turned crimson, the oblong eyes widened, and an electric flame trembled from head to foot. "Eat my head," said Surma proudly, proudly, with pain.

Udayaditya, “Slowly when the blood cooled I saw the proper amount; What is the state of the mind when the world is not a warm, swirling brain, a blood-stained drunkard's curmudgeon swirling dreamscape, but a real field of action? Fall from where! I fell without batting an eye into the abyss of hundreds of thousands of kroshas, ​​blind, blind, and darkest. Grandpa called lovingly and took him; Did I show my face to him? But until then I had to leave Raigarh. Grandpa can't live without seeing me. He used to call me. I was so afraid that I could not go at all. He himself used to come to see me and sister Viva. No shame, nothing. He didn't even ask why I didn't go. He would see us, Amod would cheer and leave.”

Udayaditya smiled and looked at Surma's face, flooding his big eyes with the most tender love. Surma understood what was coming this time. Face bowed down; Ishath became agitated. Yuvraj held her two hairs with both hands and raised her bowed face; He went closer and sat; He put his face in his mouth slowly. He wrapped his left hand around her waist and kissed her forehead with deep calm love and said-

"Then what happened, Surma, tell me? Where did this bright face, radiant with intelligence, tender with love, bright with laughter and serenely come from? Did I hope to break the deep darkness? You are my dawn, my light, my hope, did you dispel that darkness by magic?” Yuvraj repeatedly kissed Surma's face. Surma said nothing, her eyes filled with tears of joy; Yuvraj said,—

“After so long I got proper shelter. The first time I heard from you that I am not stupid, I believed it, I understood it. I learned from you that wisdom is not as steep and crooked as a dark alley, but as straight and wide as a highway. Formerly I hated you, neglected you. I did not dare to do any work. If the mind says, this is right, if self-doubt reform is said, it may not be right. I used to accept whatever was used, I didn't try to think of anything myself. After so long I felt, I am something, I am someone. So long I was invisible, you have brought me out, Surma, you have discovered me, now I want to do what my heart says is good, immediately. I have such faith in you that when you believe in me, I can believe in me without fear. Where was the strength in that Sukumar's body that you have made me strong?"

But Surma hugged her husband's bosom with immense trust. With what utter self-abnegation looked upon his face! His eyes said "I have nothing but you, so I have everything!"

Since childhood, Udayaditya has been neglected by his relatives, sometimes he likes to talk to Surma in the quiet late night of the hundred times told Purana life story chapter by chapter.

Udayaditya said, "How many more days will Surma last like this?" Meanwhile, in the Raj Sabha, how the members of the assembly are looking for me with some kind of grace, while in the interior, mother is insulting you; Even the slaves do not care about you. I can't say anything good to anyone, I keep silent, I tolerate it. You have a bright nature, but you also suffer quietly. When I couldn't make you happy, you only had to endure humiliation and pain from me, then it would have been better if we didn't get married."

Surma, — “What is he talking about? Surma is necessary at this time. What could I do to you when I was happy? Surma is a luxury, a plaything during happy times. After overcoming all the sorrows, this happiness has arisen in my mind that I am of use to you, enjoying the joy that is incomparable with sorrow for you. This is only sorrow, why could I not bear all your pains?”

Yuvraj remained silent for a while and said, “I don't think much for myself. All went well. But why do you tolerate insults for me? Like a proper wife, you have comforted me in times of sorrow, given me rest in times of trouble, but I could not save you from humiliation and shame like a husband. Your father Sreepur-Raj does not want to accept my father as the chief, not to accept you as a subordinate of Yasehharchhatra, the father wants to maintain his chieftaincy by showing neglect towards you. If someone insults you, he doesn't listen. He thinks that the son-in-law he has given you is enough for you. I think once, I can't get up anymore, abandon everything and take you away. I would have gone all these days, you only held me back.”

The night deepened. Many an evening star has set, many a deep night star has risen. The footsteps of the guards stationed at the gate can be heard from afar. The whole world is asleep. All the lamps of the city have gone out; The door is closed; There is not a single animal except a couple of jackals. The door to Udayaditya's bedroom was locked. Suddenly someone started knocking on the door from outside. The busy Prince opened the door. “Why? Biva? what happened Why have you come here so late at night?"

Readers are already aware that Viva is Udayaditya's sister. Biva said - "At this point, I understand that everything has been destroyed!" Surma and Udayaditya asked together, "Why, what happened?" Biva said quietly in a frightened voice. Couldn't stay talking anymore, started crying, said - "Grandpa what will happen?"

Udayaditya said “I will go!” Viva said "No no you don't go."

Udayaditya "Why Viva?"

Biva "If the father can know? If you are angry with me?”

Surma said, “Shi Biva; Is now the time to think about it?”

Udayaditya dressed in clothes and tied his sword around his waist and started to leave. Viva held his hand and said, "Dada, don't go, you send the people, I am afraid."

Udayaditya said—“Biva is now in the way; No more time." After saying this, he immediately went out.

Biva held Surma's hand and said, "What will happen, brother?" If the father notices?”

Surma said “what else? I feel love and there is nothing left. Even if what is there is gone, there will be no great loss.”

Biva said “No brother, I am afraid. If the father does any kind of harm. If you punish?"

Surma took a deep breath and said - "My belief - who has no help in the world, Narayan helps him more. O Lord, may your name not be tarnished! Don't break my faith!"

## Section II.

The minister said "Maharaj, will the work be good?"

Pratapaditya asked "What work?"

The minister said, "What you ordered yesterday."

Pratapaditya got annoyed and said "What did I order yesterday?"

“About your parentage,” said the minister.

Prominence "What about my parentage?" he said more annoyed.

The minister said "Maharaj had ordered that when Vasantarai would take refuge in Simultali Chatti on his way to Jessohar—"

Pratapaditya frowned and said "Then what? Finish it!”

Minister—"Then two men went—"

Pratap—“Yes.”

Minister—"Will kill him."

Pratapaditya got angry and said, "Minister, have you suddenly become a child?" Why do you have to ask ten questions to hear a word? Hesitating to say the word! Now I feel that the age of paying attention to your kingdom has passed, now the time has come to think about the hereafter. Why haven't you prayed for retirement for so long?"

Minister - "Maharaj could not understand my thoughts well."

Pratap - "I understand for a moment. But I ask you one thing, what I can do, you can't even put it in your mouth? You ought to have considered, when I was going to do this, that there was, of course, a serious reason for it; Of course, I was thinking of Dharma and Adharma.”

Minister—“Command Your Highness, I—”

Pratap — “Shut up, listen to all my words first. When I did this—when I set out to kill my father, I certainly thought more than you. There is no wrongdoing in this work. This is my vow - these Mlechchas have come to our country and started lawlessness, due to whose tyranny, traditional Arya Dharma is about to disappear from our country, Kshatriyas are giving daughters to Mughals, Hindus are depraved, I will remove these Mlechchas, our Arya-Dharma from Rahu's throat. will free A lot of strength is required to fulfill this vow. I want all the kings of Bangladesh to be united under me. It will not be accomplished unless those who are allies of Yavana are destroyed. Pithrivya Vasantaraya is my worshiper, but there is no sin in speaking the right words, he is the stain of our clan. Pratapaditya Ray has nothing to do with such a person who has accepted you as a servant of Mlechch. If wounded, one can cut off one's own arm; I want to cut off the wound of the family, the wound of Bangladesh, and save the Roy family, save Bangladesh."

The minister said, "I did not differ with His Majesty on this matter."

Pratapaditya said — “Yes, it was. speak right still have Look, minister, as long as your opinion does not coincide with mine, express it. If you don't have that courage, this position is not yours. If in doubt, tell me. Allow me to explain. You think it is always a sin to disrespect your parentage. Don't say 'no', this is exactly what you are thinking. It has an answer. Bhrigu killed his mother at the request of his father, can I not kill my father at the request of dharma?”

On this matter — that is, on the matter of religion and non-religion, the minister had no opinion. The king could not go as far as the minister could go. Minister Bilakshan knew that if he hesitated in the present matter, the king would be somewhat angry for the time being, but in the end he would be satisfied in his heart. If this is not done, the suspicion and fear of the king may arise against the minister.

The minister said, "What was I saying, Delhishwar will surely be angry after hearing this news."

Pratapaditya got up, "Yes, yes, you will be angry! Everyone has the right to be angry. Delhishwar is not my God. There are plenty of creatures who will tremble when he is angry, there is Mansingh, there is Birbal, there is our Basant Roy, and recently I see you too; But don't think of yourself as all."

The minister laughed and said, "Ajna, my lord, I am not afraid of the empty anger, but if there is a shield with him, I have to think about what will happen!" Delhishwar's rage means fifty thousand soldiers.”

Pratapaditya could not give a good answer to this and said, "Look minister, don't try to discourage me from doing any work by showing fear of Delhishwar, it hurts me completely."

The minister said, "What will the people say if they know?"

Pratap - "If you know?"

Minister - this work will not remain in print for a long time."

"If this news becomes a state, all of Bangladesh will be against you. The purpose for which you want to do this will be completely destroyed. You will be banished from the nation and will have to endure various hardships.”

Pratap - “Look, Minister, I am telling you again, I do what I do with special thought. Therefore, if I am engaged in work, do not try to discourage me by showing me some threats. I am not a child. I have not kept you as my own disciplinarian, to prevent me from doing so.”

The minister fell silent. The king had two orders for him. One, he will express as long as there is a difference of opinion, secondly, he will not try to dissuade the king from doing any work by expressing opposing views. The minister has not been able to properly reconcile these two orders till today.

After a while the minister said again “Maharaj, Delhishwar”—! Pratap Aditya got up and said, "Dilliswar again?" Minister, every time you chant the name of Delhishwar during the day, if you chant the name of Jagadishwar, you can get the work done in the afterlife. Do not mention the name of Delhishwar till I finish this work. When I get the news of this work samadha this afternoon, come to my ears and chant the name of Delhishwar! Until then, exercise some restraint!”

The minister fell silent again. Delhishwar stopped talking and said - "Maharaj, Prince Udayaditya -"

The king said—“Dilliswar is gone, the people are gone; Won't you finally scare me by talking about that girl boy?"

The minister said, “Your Highness, you are greatly mistaken. I have no intention of obstructing your work.”

Pratapaditya said coldly, "But tell me what you were talking about!"

The minister said, "Yesterday night, Yuvraj rode off alone and has not returned yet."

Pratapaditya got annoyed and said, "Which way did you go?"

“Eastward,” said the minister.

Pratapaditya gritted his teeth and said, "When did you go?"

Minister—"Tomorrow is about midnight."

Pratapaditya said "Is the daughter of the owner of Sripur here?"

Minister—"Order yes!"

Pratapaditya — "It is better if he stays in his paternal house."

The minister did not reply.

Pratapaditya said “Udayaditya was never like a king. From his childhood, he mingled with the people. Who knew that my child would be like this? What do lion cubs have to learn to be lions? But whether, Naranang Matulakrama:. I understand that he has got the nature of his maternal grandparents. On top of that, I recently got married in the house of Sreepur; Until then, the boy is completely degenerate. God, let my youngest son be worthy, if I can't finish what I started, so that at the time of my death there will be no thought! Has he not returned yet?”

Minister—“No, Your Majesty!”

Pratapaditya stomped on the ground and said, "Why didn't a guard go with him?"

Minister—"One was ready to go, but he forbade."

Pratap—"Why didn't he go invisibly, far away?"

Minister—"They suspected no wrongdoing."

Pratap - "No doubt. Minister, do you want to tell me, they did a great job? Minister, you don't try to explain anything to me in vain. The guards have been particularly negligent in their duties. Call and send who was at the door at that time. If any of my wishes fail for this event, I will destroy everything. Minister, you too are likely to be afraid of that. You have come to prove to me that no one is responsible for this! But this is your responsibility!”

Pratapaditya sent for the guards. After a long pause, he asked, “Yes. What were you talking about in Delhi?”

Minister - "I heard that a complaint has been made to Delhishwar in your name."

Pratap — “Who? Isn't it your prince Udayaditya?”

Minister—“Command, Your Highness, do not speak like that. who did Not found."

Pratap - "Whoever does it, don't think too much for him, I am the judge of Delhishwar, I am the one who will punish him. He sent them not yet returned? Udayaditya hasn't come yet? Call the guard quickly.”

## Section III.

Yuvraj's horse is galloping through Bijan Path. It is a dark night, but the road is long, straight and wide, so there is no fear. In the still night, the sound of horse hooves is echoing around, two dogs are barking and calling, two jackals are startled and hide in the bamboo bushes. Among the lights are the stars in the sky and the sycamores in the roadside trees; The restless sound of jingling between words; The skeleton-remains of men are sleeping under a beggar's old tree! After crossing five crores of road, Yuvraj left the road and landed in a field. The speed of the horse had to be moderated! It had rained during the day, the ground was wet, and the horse's feet were sinking. As it went, the horse fell down three times, leaning on its front legs. A tired horse's nostrils flared, frothing at the mouth, foaming at the friction of hind legs, a sound emanating from inside the cage, flooded with sweat. Meanwhile, a great summer, just no wind, still a long way to go. After crossing many marshes and cultivated fields, the Prince finally came to a dirt road. He galloped the horse again. Once he squeezed his neck and called out encouragingly, "Sugriva!" He cocked his ears once and looked at the Lord with big eyes, bankim gaze, once bowed his neck and hummed and bowed his face and relaxed his rush and bowed his neck and took a deep breath. The trees on both sides are not visible to the eyes, looking at the sky, it seems as if the stars are flying like sparks in groups and the stagnant air waved in the sky and began to flicker near the ears. In the third watch of the night, when the jackals called near Lekalai, the prince came and stood at the door of Shimultali's chattel, and his horse immediately passed out and fell to the ground. Namiya patted his back, lifted his face and called him Sugriv several times, he did not move. Taking a long breath, the prince went to the door and knocked. After repeated blows, the principal of the chatty did not open the door and said through the window - "Who are you at night?" Saw an armed young man standing at the door.

Yuvraj said "I will ask one thing Dwar Khael."

He said, "Is it necessary to open the door, what has to be asked, do not ask!"

The Yuvaraj asked—“Is Vasantara, the king of Raigarh, here?”

He said - "He was supposed to come after evening, but he has not come yet." I understand today, he did not come."

Yuvaraj took two coins and said loudly - "Take this."

He ran quickly, opened the door and took two coins. Then Yuvraj said to him - "Bapu, I will search your chat once and see who is there?"

The chatti-keeper said doubtfully - "No, sir, it will not happen."

Udayaditya said — “Don't stop me. I am an employee of Rajbati. I have come in search of two criminals.”

Saying this he entered. The chatti-keeper did not stop him. He searched everything. Neither Basant Ray, nor his attendants, nor any Pathan could be seen. Only the two Suptothita Praudha shouted, "Why are you looking at me like that?"

After coming out of the chatty and standing on the road, Yuvraj began to think. Once he thought that it was good, maybe he couldn't come today by chance. He thought again if he was in a chat before him and the Pathans went there in search of him? Thinking like this, he started walking that way. When he went far, he saw a horseman coming from the opposite direction. When he came near, he said, "Who? Ratan or not?" He immediately got down from the horse and bowed to him and said, “Ajna Ha. Prince, are you here so late?”

Yuvraj said “I will tell you the reason later. Now tell me where is Grandpa Mahashay.”

"Ajna, he is supposed to stay on the floor."

“What is he? I did not see him there."

He was surprised and said, "Maharaj Yasha has journeyed to Yasha with thirty attendants. I practically fell behind. Miliba is supposed to be with him in this chatty this evening.”

"I went in search of him following the mud on the road, where there are supposed to be footprints. I took your sword. You come on foot!”

## Chapter IV.

Old Vasantarai is sitting in an uncarried earthen bed under a ashtha tree by the side of Bijan Path. There is no one else nearby, only a Pathan outside the camp. A throng of people mingled in the distance. Rajni was stunned. Vasanthara asked—

"Sir, didn't you go?"

Pathan said, "Lord, what shall I do?" You sent all your attendants to protect our lives and property. I will leave you unprotected at night by this road, do not disturb me so great an ungrateful one. Our poet says, whoever wrongs me is indebted to me, he will have to repay that debt in the hereafter; I am indebted to him who has done me good, but I will never be able to repay him.”

Vasantaraya thought to himself, Wow, that's great. After debating for a while, he stuck out his bald head from the palanquin and said, "Khan Sahib, you look very good."

Khan Saheb immediately made a salam. There was no difference of opinion between Khan Saheb and Basant Roy on this matter. Vasantarai examined his face in the light of the torch and said, "You look like a man from a big house."

Pathan saluted again and said "Kya Tajjab, Maharaj, you are right."

"What do you do now?" said Vasantara.

Pathan breathed out and said, "Lord, I am in dire straits, now I have to live in farming and run Gujran." The poet says - "O blind man, your cruelty is not revealed in the fact that you have turned grass into grass, but you have turned a bad tree into a bad tree and finally leveled it with the grass in the hands of the storm. I am guessing that your mind is made of stone!"

Vasantaraya was extremely happy and said, "Bahba, Bahba, what the poet has said. Sir, the two years that you said today, those two have to be written down."

Pathan thought, his vision is happy. Old people are big; It will be of great use to the poor. Vasantaraya thought, ah, the person who was once a great man is now in such a plight! Chapla Lakshmi's big torture! In his heart, he was a little worried, said to Pathan-

"With your beautiful body, you can easily join the army."

Pathan immediately said "Hujur Pari Baiki!" That is our job. All my fathers and grandfathers have died by the hand of Talaya, I have only that sadha. The poet says,-

Basanta Raya said with a smile, "Whatever the poet says, Bapu, if you accept my work, then you can die by the sword, but you will not be able to open that sword from its sheath." I am old, the people are happy and at ease, God, that there is no need to fight anymore. Age is gone; I left the sword. Now another has taken my water instead of the sword.” Saying this, he woke up the sitar who was lying on the side with two bells.

Pathan shook his head and closed his eyes and said, "Oh, what you are saying is right. There is a saying that swords can conquer enemies, but music can make enemies friends.”

Vasantaraya said, "What did you say, sir? Music can turn enemies into allies, how wonderful!” He thought for a while in silence, the more he thought, the more surprised he became. After a while, he explained the story and said, "The sword is such a terrible thing that even the enmity of the enemy cannot be destroyed, how can it be destroyed?" But music is such a sweet thing that it can destroy enmity without destroying the enemy. What is this general poetry? Wow, what a compliment!” The old man got so excited that he sat down outside the camp, asked the Pathan to come nearer and said "The enemy can be conquered with the sword, but the enemy can be made friends with music, how is it, sir?"

Send—"Command yes, sir."

Vasantarai — “You go to Raigarh once. I will return from Jessore and do you the best I can!”

Pathan excitedly said "You can do whatever you want!" Pathan thought, I've got it sorted somehow. “Do you like to play the sitar?” he asked.

"Yes," said Vasanthara. He immediately picked up the sitar. Behag began to talk with the mezrap on his finger. Sometimes Pathan shook his head and said, "Wow! Khasi.” Gradually, under the influence of excitement, it became impossible for Vasantarai to sit in Shivika. He stood up and started playing. All seriousness was soon forgotten and he finally sang—“Kayse katongi rayon, so piya bina.”

When the song stopped, Pathan said, "What a wonderful voice."

Vasantara said, "But I understand, in the quiet night, in the open field, everyone's voice is sweet. Because, the voice has achieved a lot, but people don't appreciate my voice much. However, God has given one or the other medicine for all the diseases he has given, just as he has given one or the other audience for all the throats he has given. I also have two Arbbachins that I like in my throat. Otherwise, sir, I would have closed this neck shop; There are those two clumsy buyers, they don't know the goods, they also carry them from close quarters. I haven't seen the two for a long time, the songs are also off; So I'm running away; I will return home after listening to the music of my heart, taking down the burden of my life. The old man's dim eyes shone with love and joy.

Pathan said in his heart, "One of your vows has been fulfilled, the song has been sung, now I will take down the burden of life?" Teba, Teba, works like that! There is virtue in killing an infidel, but I have acquired that virtue so much that I don't think much about the hereafter, but I don't mind if I can take one of the infidels without killing them.

Vasantara could not remain silent for a long time; His imagination was excited; Approaching Pathan, he said very quietly, "Who were you talking about, sir, do you know? They are my grandson and granddaughter.” He became increasingly impatient, thinking, "When will my followers come back." Sitar Laiya song again. started

A man on horseback came near and said, "Ah, I am saved." Grandfather, who are you singing to on the side of the road so late at night?"

Overwhelmed with joy and wonder, Vasantaraya at once placed his sitar aloft, took hold of Udayaditya's hand, and took him down in a firm embrace; He asked, "What's the news, grandpa?" Didi is fine?"

Udayaditya said "All is well."

Then the old man with a smile picked up the sitar and began to sing, putting his feet to the rhythm and shaking his head.

"Bandhua untimely why O Prakash?

All that dream is faith.

You were in the corner of Chandrabali, where you met?

Eri Mitil Ki Pranereri Ash!

It's still night, it's not dawn yet,

Radhika has not yet shed tears.

Is Chandrabali's yellow dress dry today?

Chokor, Milal, is that the sweet smile of the moon?”

Udayaditya looked at Pathan and asked Vasantaraya in his ear, "Dada Mahashay, where did this confession come from?"

Vasantarai quickly said, “Khan Sahib, great and good man. sane person Tonight was spent in great joy.”

Seeing Udayaditya, Mr. Khan was very agitated, he could not think of what to do.

Udayaditya asked the grandfather, "Why not go to Chatti?"

Pathan suddenly said, "I will tell you when I get the assurance of the Lord." We are the subjects of King Pratapaditya. Your Majesty orders me and my brother that when you come to Jessohar's mouth, you are killed on the way!”

Vasantara was startled and shouted "Ram, Ram, Ram!"

Udayaditya said "Say it!"

Pathan—“We have never done such a thing, so he threatens us in various ways to make us object. So I was forced to travel for this purpose. I met you on the way. My brother took your attendants crying saying that robbers have fallen in the village. I was burdened with this work. But, my lord, though it be the king's command, I was by no means inclined to such a work. For, says our poet, by the command of the king, by the command of the Lord, you may destroy the whole earth, but beware, do not destroy even a corner of heaven. Now the poor, took refuge in Maharaj. I will be destroyed if I return to the country. If you don't save me, I have no choice!” Saying, he stood with his hands together.

Vasantarayo stood in surprise. After a while he said to Pathan - "I am giving you a letter, you should go to Raigarh. I will go back there and do you a favor.”

Udayaditya said, "Grandfather, won't you go to Jessohar again?"

Vasantaraya said "Yes brother!"

Udayaditya was surprised and said, "What is that?"

Vasantarai - "Pratap is no one else to me, let him commit a thousand crimes, he is my absolute darling! I do not fear any harm to myself. I am brother, standing by the sea; A wave is all I need. But if I commit this sin, I can be at ease thinking about the loss of glory in this life and the next. Hug him and explain everything once."

Vasantaraya's eyes were filled with tears. Udayaditya covered his eyes with both hands.

At such a time Vasantaraya's attendants came back making noise.

"Where is the king? Where is the king?”

"I am here Bapu, where else will I go?"

Everyone said in unison - "Where is that boy?"

Vasantaraya got embarrassed and said, "Yes, yes, father, don't say anything to your Khan Saheb."

First—“Today, my lord, I have suffered greatly, today he—”

Second—“Thou Thamanare; I say everything well done. He sent the boy along with us and finally left into a mango orchard—”

Third—“Nare seta acacia forest.”

Fourth—"It's not left-handed, it's right-handed!"

Second—"Far anger, that's left-handed."

Fourth—"He said he was left-handed?"

Second—"Left-handed, if not, that pond—"

Udayaditya — "Yes, Bapu, it hurts by saying it is left-handed, then say it."

Second—“Command yes! The left-handed man took it to a field through the mango garden. I crossed many cultivated fields, swamps, and bamboo groves, but I could not even smell the name of the village. After walking around for three hours, I could not find where the boy had escaped from near the village.

First - "I can't stop seeing that boy."

Second—"I also thought something like this would happen."

Third—"When I saw the wave, I doubted it!"

Finally everyone expressed that they understood everything from before.

## Fifth Section.

Pratapaditya said, "Look, Minister, the two he sent have not arrived yet!"

The minister slowly said, "It is not my fault, Your Majesty!"

Pratapaditya got annoyed and said, "There is no talk of guilt. Is there a reason for the delay? I am asking what you guessed.”

the minister “Shimultali is far from here. There should be a delay in going, completing work and coming back.”

Pratapaditya was dissatisfied with the words of the minister. He wants, what he also guesses, the minister also guesses. But the minister did not go in that direction. Pratapaditya said, "Did Udayaditya go out last night?"

the minister "Yes, I have told you before."

Prominence "I told you before! You told me at the right time. Do you understand that your work is finished when you say yes? Udayaditya was not like this in the past. The daughter of the zamindar of Sreepur must have given him bad advice. What's wrong?"

the minister "How shall I say, my lord?"

Pratapaditya said, “Do I want to listen to Vedavakya from you? Guess what, don't say it!”

the minister "You hear all the talk of Badhumata Thakurani from the buffalo, you can guess about it, how can I guess?"

A Pathan entered the house.

Pratapaditya said - "What happened?" Have you finished your work?”

send "Yes, Your Highness, it has been drained by now."

Prominence “What kind of talk is that? But you don't know?”

send "Ajna, yes, I know. The work is done, there is nothing wrong with that, but I was not present at the time.”

Prominence "But what happened?"

send "According to your advice, I have separated his people and left, Hasen Khan has finished his work."

Predominance! "Doesn't the clock tick?"

send "Maharaj, I put my head on bail."

Prominence “Well be there. Your brother will be rewarded when he returns.”

Pathan stood in charge of the guards near the far gate.

Pratapaditya remained silent for a long time and slowly said to the minister, "We will have to try so that the people do not know this."

The minister said — "Maharaj, do not be displeased if I tell you it will be revealed."

Probability "How would you know?"

the minister In the past you have openly expressed your hatred towards your parentage. You did not invite Vasantharaya during your daughter's marriage, he himself came uninvited. Today you suddenly invited him for no reason and killed him on the way. In such a situation, the people will know you as the root of this incident.”

Pratapaditya got angry and said - "I can't understand anything about you, Minister! May you be happy when this word is revealed, may your heart be filled with my condemnation. If not, why do you say day and night that the word will be revealed. I see no reason to publish. I understand, and if the news doesn't go to the state, you will go door to door and publish it yourself!"

The minister said - "Maharaj, forgive me." You understand everything better than me. Advising you is quite a challenge for small-minded people like us. However, it is not you who have kept me as a minister, I sometimes tell you what seems to be small-mindedness in this courage. If you are angry with the ministry, then release this servant from this task.”

Pratapaditya straightened up. Sometimes Pratapaditya was satisfied when the minister gave him a hard word or two."

Pratapaditya said, "I consider, if those two Pathans are killed, there will be no more reason to fear in this matter."

The minister said, "One murder is a responsibility to suppress, three murders are impossible to deal with." People will know." The minister always kept his word.

Pratapaditya said, "But I was full of fear! People will know! Yeshehar is not Raigarh; There is no rule of the subjects here. Here, except the king, everyone else is not a king. So don't make me afraid of the people. If any people say anything against me about this, I will burn his tongue with a red-hot iron.”

The minister smiled to himself. He said to himself, "The tongue of the people is so afraid. However, the mind is taught to not fear any people!"

Prominence "After completing Shraddha Shanti, we have to go to Raigarh once with people. I do not see anyone else as heir to the throne there except me.”

Old Vasantaraya slowly entered the house—Pratapaditya recoiled in surprise. Suddenly he thought, I understand the deity. He was surprised and could not say a word. Vasantara went close and put his hands on him and said in a soft voice - "What am I afraid of Pratap?" I am your father. If you don't believe in that, I am old, I don't have the power to harm you."

Pratapaditya is conscious, but he is very inept at making up words. He stood there surprised without answering. It was not enough to bow down to fatherhood.

Vasantarai said slowly again - "Pratap, whatever happens, speak." If by God you have done such a thing, in which you feel shame and embarrassment at the sight of me, then do not even think about it. I will not raise any issues. S years; The two of us cuddle once. Today we met after many days; We will not see each other for a long time."

After this time Pratapaditya bowed down and got up and cooed with his father. Meanwhile, the minister slowly left the house. Basantara Ishat smiled softly and put his hand on Pratapaditya and said, "Basantara has lived for a long time - or Pratap? The time has come, God knows why the call has not been made yet. But no more delay."

Vasantara remained silent for some time, Pratapaditya did not answer. Vasantaraya said again, “But let me clarify everything. That you have taken a knife at me has struck me more than a knife. (His eyes watered as he said) But I am not angry at all. I will only tell you two things. Do not kill me Pratap! It will not be good for you in this life and the hereafter. If you can wait for my death for so long, can't you do it for two more days? Shall be the sharer of sin for this piece?”

Vasantara saw that Pratapaditya did not answer; He did not deny guilt, or speak of repentance; Immediately he said something else, "Pratap, go to Raigarh once." Haven't been there for a long time. Will see many changes. The soldiers now left the ground and took up the plough; The guest house where the soldiers were quartered—”

At that time, Pratapaditya saw from a distance that the pathan was trying to escape. Couldn't stay any longer. The pent-up anger that was bubbling up in the mind, became excited like a source of fire. He said in a loud voice - "Khabardar do not leave him." Hold tight.” Saying that, he hurried out of the house.

The king called the minister and said, "Your disrespect for the royal duties is being noticed."

The minister slowly said, "Maharaj, I have no fault in this matter."

Pratapaditya said in his voice, "Am I referring to something! I am saying that you are very disrespectful to the government. I left a letter with you that day, but you lost it!”

One and a half months ago, something like this happened, but then Maharaj did not say a word to the minister.

"And one day I ordered you to go to Umesh Roy, you sent people and finished the work! Shut up! Don't try to make excuses! Be that as it may, I let you know that you pay no attention to royal affairs.”

The king called the guards. Formerly the night watchmen had their wages cut, now they were ordered to be imprisoned.

He went to Antapur and called the buffalo and said, "Buffalo! I see a lot of chaos in the royal family! Udayaditya was not like this in the East. Now when he goes out. Joins the work of the people. opposes me What is the meaning of all this?”

Mahishi was scared and said, "Maharaj, there is no fault in him! The root of all these misfortunes is the old woman! I was never like that before. From the day he got married in the house of Sreepur, I can't understand anything about how Uday happened from that day."

Maharaj ordered to keep Surma under control and went out. Mahishi sent for Udayaditya. When Udayaditya came, he looked at his face and said, “Ah, my son, my anger has turned black! How was the color of the child before marriage! Like a hot army! Who made him like that? Father, don't listen to what old lady tells you. He has become like this after listening to him.” Surma was standing on one side keeping silent with the veil. Mahishi began to say, "He is born in a small clan, is he worthy of it?" Does he know how to advise you? I speak the right words and when he does not give good advice, let him live if he is bad! Maharaj gave her in marriage to such a demon!” The buffalo started shedding tears.

Sweat spots appeared on Udayaditya's calm forehead. Lest the impatience of his mind should be revealed, he turned his gaze to the other side.

An old, old maid was sitting, she waved her hand and said, — “The girls of Sripur know magic. The child must have been drugged." Saying this, he got up and went to Udayaditya and said, “Father, he has given you medicine. The girl you see, she is not a little girl! Sreepur house girl. They are witches! Didn't you put anything else in the body of the child?" Saying this, he shot a look like an arrow at Surma and rubbed his two dry eyes with his hands and made them red. Seeing that, the buffalo's sorrow completely disappeared. Lately, the contagion of crying spread among the old women. Everyone gathered in the queen's house with the intention of crying. Udayaditya Karunnetre once looked at Surma's face. Surma saw it through the sweat, she wiped her eyes and slowly went home without saying a word.

In the evening Mahishi said to Pratapaditya, today I explained everything to Udaya. Not so my son. If you explain it, you understand it. Today his eyes are open.

## Chapter Six.

Seeing Biva's pale face, Surma couldn't stay any longer; He held his throat and said, "Biva, why are you silent? Why don't you tell him what's on his mind?"

"What else do I have to say?" said Viva slowly.

Surma said, "I haven't seen him for a long time, how will he feel!" You don't write a letter asking him to come. I will facilitate the sending of his grandfather.”

Biva's husband Chandradwipati Ramachandra Roy is being talked about.

Biva shrugged and started saying, "If someone here does not accept him, if someone does not consider it necessary to call him, then it is better if he does not come here. If he comes, I will forbid. He is the king, where he is not loved, why would he come? Why is he less than us, that the father should insult him?” Bibha couldn't handle it any more, her face turned red and she started crying.

Surma placed Viva's face on her chest and wiped her tears and said, "Well, Viva, what would you do if you were a man?" Didn't you go to your father-in-law's house because the invitation letter didn't pass?"

Viva said, “No, I could not do that. If I were a man I would leave now; I didn't think anything insulting. But why will he come if you do not call him after saying that?

Viva has never said so much. A lot has been said about emotions today. By now, I felt a little shy. I think I have talked too much. Again, as I said, big shame? Gradually the tension in his mind subsided and a heavy depression slowly began to press in his mind. Biva covered her face with her arms and lay down with her head on Surma's lap; Surma bowed her head and began to separate her thick hair with soft hands! How long has it been? Neither of them said a word. Beaver is dripping water from her eyes one by one and Surma is wiping them slowly.

After a long time, when the evening came, Viva slowly sat up and wiped her tears and smiled! The meaning of that smile is "What a boy have I done today!" He gradually turned his face away and tried to run away. Surma held his hand without saying anything. Without raising anything else, he said, "Viva, have you heard, grandfather has come?"

Biva "Grandpa has come?"

Surma. "Yes."

"When did you come?" asked Viva with interest.

Surma. "About four o'clock."

Biva "He hasn't come to see us yet."

Beaver's heart was full of pride. Biva is very cautious after taking possession of Dada Mahashay. In fact, one day Vasantaraya had a long conversation with Udayaditya and made Vivah wait for three steps in the entrance, but did not go to see him once, because of this Vivah was so distressed that even though he did not say anything about it, he could talk to Dadamahashaya with a happy face. no

Vasantaraya entered the room and sang with a smile;-

"Today I see Temer after a long time!

fear not, be happy,

don't stay longer

I have come to Dudanderi!

I'll just eat my face

Two sweet words

I will go to the country after seeing the smile from behind!"

Vivah bowed her face and smiled after listening to the song. He is very happy. So happy that he is embarrassed to be caught.

Surma lifted Biva's face and said, "Dada sir, didn't you have to hide to see Biva's smile?"

Vasantarai “No. Biva thought, if not laughing at all is not the old farewell, then at least a little smile. I understand the meaning of the Dakini, a trick to chase me! But it's not happening anytime soon. If I come, I will burn you well, I will remember you until I see you again!"

Surma smiled and said, "Look, grandpa, Viva said in my ear that if the intention is to remember, then what you have lit is enough, and there is no need to light it again."

Vasantaraya was very happy after hearing this. He started laughing.

Viva said incredulously, “No, I have never spoken. I didn't say anything."

Surma said, “Dada sir, your wish has been fulfilled! If you wanted to see laughter, you saw it, if you wanted to hear words, I heard them, but now go to the country.”

Vasantarai "No brother, I couldn't do it! I've brought a bunch of songs and a full head of hair, I can't leave without draining them all!”

Viva couldn't stay any longer, laughed and said, "You don't have half your head of hair, grandpa!"

Dadamahshay's ambition was fulfilled. After many days, Beaver's mouth required some manipulation of the skull at the first meeting, but once Beaver's mouth opened to Dada Mahashay, more manipulation was required to close it. But under no circumstances did Beaver open his mouth to Kahara except for Dada Mahashay.

Vasantarai shook his hand and said, "He is gone one day, brother! On the day Vasantaraya had a single head of hair, would I have walked so many roads to please you? If you plucked one strand of hair, you would be willing to pull out five beautiful hairs like you and ten raw hairs would be plucked out of your heart!"

"Well grandpa, did you look better when you had a head of hair than you do now?" asked Viva in a serious tone.

Beaver had a strange suspicion about that. Grandpa Mahashay's swagger, his innocent broad smile, his ripe old man's expression, he tried to change in his mind, but it didn't work well at all. He saw that if he didn't give the takt, his grandpa wouldn't agree to anything. And if you add a mustache, Dada Mahashay's face looks really bad. It gets so bad that he can't help but smile when he imagines it. Grandpa's mustache again! Grandfather is not bald again!

"There is a lot of disagreement on that," said Vasanthara. My granddaughters are fascinated by my baldness, they have never seen my hair. My grandmothers were fascinated by Apar's hair, they never saw my baldness. Those who have seen both are still unable to agree.”

Biva said, "But saying that, if you go bald more than you are, it won't look good!"

Surma said, “Dadamhashay bald will be discussed later. Now, beaver, make a way!”

Biva quickly went to Vasantarai and said, "Grandfather - I will lift your gray hair."

Surma. "I say what"—

Biva “Listen grandpa, your—”

Surma. "Biva shut up. I say, once you go—”

Biva "Grandfather, you have nothing but gray hair on your head, if you remove it, all heads will fall bald!"

Vasantarai "If you don't listen to me, sister, if you disturb me, I will talk angrily."

Balia began to twist the ears of his miniature sitar. Biva had a special hatred for Hindol Ragas.

Viva said, “What a disaster. But I ran away and left the house."

Then Surma became serious and said, "I think even the Maharaja would have mercy if I could be silent and know the pain she carries day and night in her life!"

“Why! Why! What happened to him!” Balaya went to Surma with great interest and sat down.

Surma said, "Doesn't anyone remember to invite Tagore-Jamai one day in a year?"

Vasantaraya will think and say, "That's right!"

Surma said, "How many girls can bear this disrespect for their husbands?" Viva is a good person, so don't say anything to anyone, cry in your heart."

Vasantaraya was confused and said, "Do you cry secretly in your mind?"

Surma. "I had so much to cry about this afternoon."

Vasantarai "Was Viva crying this afternoon?"

Surma. "Yes!"

Vasantarai "Ah, call him once, I see!"

Surma caught Viva. Vasantarai held her chin and said, "Why are you crying, sister?" Why don't you tell your grandfather what's wrong with him? So I do my best? I go now, tell Pratap to come!”

Biva said, “Grandfather, don't tell your father anything about me. Grandpa, don't fall on your feet!”

Basantara went out to sacrifice in the rally; He went to Pratapaditya and said, "You have not invited your son-in-law for a long time. This shows complete neglect towards him. If you don't respect the son-in-law of the father-in-law as much as you should respect him, then it is an insult to you. There is nothing to be proud of.”

Pratapaditya did not dispute the words of his father. It was ordered to send the letter of invitation to Chandradwip along with the people.

Coming to Biva and Surma in Anthapura, Vasantaraya's sitar playing got lost.

"Dirty face with a smile and two eyes!"

Viva said shyly, "Grandfather, have you told all my words to father?" Vasantara began to sing,

"Dirty face with a smile, twin eyes.

I like to leave the dirty seat, then cover it up.”

Viva put her hands on the strings of the sitar and closed the sitar and said again, "Have you spoken about me to my father?"

At that time Udayaditya's eighth-year-old son Samraditya peeked into the room and said, "Oh, sister! Talking with grandpa! I am coming to tell my mother."

“Come, come, brother come!” Saying, Vasantarai arrested him.

It is the belief of the royal family that Vasantaraya and Surma combined to destroy Udayaditya. For this purpose, when Vasantara comes, Samal Samal falls. Samraditya started a tug-of-war to shake off Vasantaraya's hand. Basantara gave him a sitar, put him on his shoulders, put him under glasses, and subdued him between two bars, so that all those days, Dada started going back and forth behind Mahashay and continued to play the sitar, tore the five strings of his sitar and cut off the mezrap and did not give it anymore!

## Chapter VII.

Ramachandra Roy, king of Chandradwip, is sitting in his palace. The house is octagonal. A cloth-wrapped stick hangs from the rope. In one of the niches of the wall, there are images of Lord Ganesha and the rest of Lord Krishna in various states. They are hand-made by the famous craftsman Batakrishna Kumbhakar. Sheets are spread all around, in the middle is a mattress made of shriveled fish, on which is a king and a taqiya. It has a lace fringe on its four corners. Hanging native mirrors around the wall, the face cannot be seen properly. Even in all the man-mirrors around the king, he can't see his face properly, his body looks too big. To the left of the king is a huge Albaela and minister Harishankar. To the south of the king is Ramai Bhand, and the bespectacled commander Fernandez.

The king said, "Oh Rama!"

Ramai said, "Order, Your Majesty!"

King laughed. The minister laughed more than the king. Fernandez clapped and laughed. Ramai's eyes twinkled with satisfaction. The king thinks that not laughing at Ramai's words shows the sarcasm; The minister thinks that the king has a duty to laugh; Fernandez, however, has something to laugh about. Unfortunately, when Rama opens his lips, Daibat does not smile, Rama leaves him crying. Few people laugh with joy after hearing the jokes of Nehil Ramai's brainchild. However, fear and sense of duty made everyone smile, starting from the king to the gatekeeper.

The king asked, "What is the news?"

Rama thought a joke must be made.

"It was heard in the tradition that a thief had fallen into the house of the commander."

The commander became impatient. He understood that an old story was being tried on him. As he is afraid of Ramai's jokes, Ramai always squeezes him. The king is very happy! As soon as Rama arrived, Fernandez was sent for. There are two main pleasures in the life of a king; Watching a sheep fight, and putting Fernandez in front of Ramai's face. Not a single bullet or arrow scratched the commander until he entered the kingdom. That person has come to cry 'crying' after eating balls of laughter. Please forgive the reader, we cannot record all of Ramai's jokes, most places will have to be omitted due to Suruchi's request.

The king narrowed his eyes and asked, “After that?”

"Submit your majesty! (Fernandez took off his coat and began to put it on.) Thieves used to sneak into the commander's house three or four times a day. Saheb's Brahmin pushed the boss a lot, but could not wake up the boss."

the king "Ha ha ha ha ha."

the minister "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

commander "Heh heh."

"During the day, not being able to bear the oppression of the housewife anymore, he said with his hands, "I will catch the thief today, because of you." At two o'clock in the night, the housewife said, "The thief has come!" The owner said, "That light that is burning in the house! The thief will run away if he sees us.” He called the thief and said, "You have escaped today." There is light in the house, today we can escape safely, come tomorrow and see how we don't get caught in the dark."

King “Ha ha ha ha!”

Minister "Hehehehehehe!"

commander "Heh."

The king said, "After that?"

Rama saw that the king was not satisfied yet. "I don't know why the thief wasn't scared enough. After that he came home at night too. Ginny said, "You're dead, get up." "Don't get up!" said the master. "What am I going to do when I get up?" asked Ginny. The master said, “Why; Don't turn on a light in the house. I can't see anything!" Ginny is furious; The boss got even more angry and said, "Look, everything went wrong for you." Turn on the light and bring the gun!” In the meantime, the thief finished his work and said, "Sir, you can feed me tobacco!" It's been a lot of work." The boss scolded and said, "Race son! I am giving tobacco. But if he comes to me, I will blow his head off with this gun.” After eating tobacco, the thief said, "Sir, if you light the light, it will be beneficial." I can't find the seal has fallen." The commander said, "Beta is afraid. Stay away, don't come close." He quickly turned on the light. The thief left after slowly packing the things. “Beta Bisham is scared,” the boss told Ginny.

The king and the minister cannot contain their laughter. Fernandez continued to "heh heh" and began to laugh out loud.

The king said, "Ramai, have you heard that I am going to my father-in-law's house?"

Ramai made a face and said, “Asarang khalu samsarang sarang swashurmandirang (Laughter. First a king, then a minister, then a general.) It is not a lie. (With a long breath) All the essence of the father-in-law's temple,—the food, the honor; Milk juice is available, fish paste is available; All fertilizers. Only the most vain woman!”

The King laughed and said “What is that, your half”—

Ramai said anxiously, "Maharaj, don't call him half-hearted." There is hope that if I do penance for three births, one day I will be able to become half of it. Even if you add five half-members like me, it does not shrink in size!” (Laughter respectively) And everyone understood the meaning of the words, not only the minister could not, but the minister had to laugh the most for this reason.

The king said, "I have heard that your Brahmin is very calm and very good at housework."

Ramai "What work in those words! There are all sorts of messes in the house, only I can't stand it. In the morning, the housewife shakes it so much that I fall at the door of the king."

Here we introduce Ramai's Brahmin in the context of speech. He is very emaciated and getting weaker day by day. When Rama comes home, he does not know where he will take shelter. In the Raj Sabha, Rama shows his teeth in one way and when he comes home, he shows his teeth in another way to the housewife. But if you describe the correct nature of the housewife, or if the humor does not come, the pity comes, for this reason, Rama describes his housewife as obese and fierce, the king and the ministers can't stop laughing!

After the laughter stopped, the king said, O Ramai, you will have to go, I will take the commander with you.

The commander understood that this time Ramai would attack him a second time. He lifted the glasses to his eyes and began to take them off and put them on.

Ramai said, "Senapati Mahashay can have no objection to go to the festival site, because it is no longer a battle ground!"

The king and the minister thought that a very funny thing was coming; He asked with interest, "Why?"

Ramai "In the eyes of the Lord, day and night are glasses. Wear glasses while sleeping; Otherwise, you cannot dream well. The commander has no objection to going to war, only, lest the cannon balls hit the glass of the glasses and the glass breaks and the eyes tear, this is the fear! How are you sir?”

The commander narrowed his eyes and said, "What is it?" He got up from his seat and said, "Maharaj, if you order, I will leave."

The king asked the general to prepare for the journey, "Take all measures for the journey." Let my sixty-four-masted boat be ready.” The minister and the commander left.

The king said, “Ramai, you have heard everything. Last time in-laws did me a lot?"

Ramai "Ajna Yes, Maharaja's lungul was made."

The king smiled, his teeth flashed, but in his mind there was a dark cloud. He is not very pleased to hear that Rama has come to know this news. And if anyone knew, it wouldn't have hurt as much. He continued to pull the gurguri.

Ramai said, "One of your brothers-in-law came and told me that the tail of your king has been revealed in the living room; Is he Ramachandra, Ramdas? I didn't know that before." I immediately said, "How do you know in advance?" It was not there before. Yasmin has come to your house to get married, so Yasmin has resorted to all manners in the country.”

The king is very happy to hear the answer! He thought that his face and that of his ancestors brightened from Rama, and Pratapaditya's Aditya suddenly became immortal. The king did not owe a great deal to war. He magnifies all these small incidents like war crimes. For so long he had thought that his enemy had suffered a humiliating defeat. Day and night he remembered this disgrace and he used to ask the world to hesitate in shame. Today his mind was much comforted that Commander Rama had won the battle. But still the burden of shame did not completely go away from his mind.

The king said to Ramai, "Ramai, this time we have to go and win." If you win, I will give you my ring.”

Ramai said, "Maharaj Jay's thoughts? If you can take Rama to Anthapura, then I can even make mother-in-law Thakurani drink ghol to her heart's content."

The king said, "His thoughts? I will take you to the inner city.”

Ramai said "What is impossible for you?"

The king also believes the same. What can he do? If someone from the loyal class says, "May the king's victory be fulfilled, fulfill the servant's desire." His Highness Ramachandra Roy immediately said "Yes, that will be." Let no one think that there are things which cannot be done by him. He decided to take Ramai Bhand to Pratapaditya's inner city, to make fun of the buffalo-mother himself, but his name is Raja Ramachandra Raya. If he could do such a great work, then what king is he?

Chandradwipadhipati, sent for Rammohan Mal. Rammohan Mal was like Bhima in prowess. The body is about four and a half cubits long. Muscles are wavy all over the body. He is a man of the reign of the heavenly king. Ramachandra has been nurtured since childhood. Everyone fears Ramai, if Ramai fears anyone, it is Rammohan. Rammohan hated Ramai very much. How Rama automatically shrank at the sight of his hatred. If he could avoid Rammohan's gaze, he would not leave. Rammohan came and stood. The king said, fifty attendants will go with him. Rammohan will become their leader.

Rammohan said, "That order, will Ramai Thakur go?" Ramai Tagore's cat-eyed squint shrank.

## Section VIII.

Today the workers are very busy at Jessohar Rajbati. The son-in-law will come, various initiatives have to be taken. Elaborate arrangements are being made for them. Mahishi had no disagreement with Pratapaditya about the fact that the dynasty of Chandradwip was inferior to that of Jessohar, yet today he is very happy that his son-in-law will come. Since morning, he has started decorating Viva with his own hands - Viva is in a strange mess. Because the young couple with the elderly mother have different tastes about the method of decoration, but what happens, the buffalo knows what the beaver is good at. Biva thought in her heart that if she wore three thin purple bangles, her white little hands would look bigger; Mahishi was so delighted to wear her with eight matte senna bangles and a big diamond necklace, that all the old maids of the house and The widow sent for Pisidig. Bibha knew that the nose would not fit her little Sukumar's mouth in any way - but Mahishi put a big nose on her and turned her face once to the right side and then to the left side and began to inspect it with pride. Bibha kept quiet about this too, but the way Mahishi tied her hair became unbearable for her. She secretly went to Surma and tied her hair as per her wish. But it could not escape the gaze of the buffalo. Mahishi saw that all of Beaver's clothes were soiled just because of hair tie. He clearly saw Surma jealously tied Biva's hair badly; - Biva tried to open her eyes to Surma's nefarious intentions; - After waiting for a long time, when he decided that the work was done, he untied her hair and tied it again! In this way, Vivah is completely embarrassed by carrying the burden of her hair, her nose, her two-armed bangles, her one heart-filled joy. He has realized that he cannot keep the fierce excitement in his heart, it just flashes like lightning in his eyes. He feels that even the walls of the house are trying to mock him. Prince Udayaditya came and saw Biva's smiling face with deep loving calm joy. He was so happy to see Beaver Harsh that he went home and kissed Surma with a gentle smile. did

Surma asked, “What?”

"Nothing!" said Udayaditya.

At such a time, Vasanthara forcibly dragged Viva and brought her into the room. Holding his chin, he lifted his face and said - "Look, grandfather, look at your beaver's face today!" Surma,—O Surma, take a look!” The old man laughed with joy. Beaver looked at his face and said, "If you are happy, don't smile, brother, let's see!"

"How can I hold on to my feet with a smile,

The soul of laughter plays that elusive game!”

If I didn't get old, I would have read his face today and died! Alas, alas, the age of death is gone! I used to die in my youth. If you don't get sick in old age, you don't die anymore!”

When Pratapaditya was approached by his brother-in-law, he asked, "Who has gone to welcome the son-in-law Babaji?" “What do I know!” he said. "Today, of course, we have to give light on the way?" The Maharaja said with wide eyes, "Of course you have to pay, there is no such thing!" Then the prince hesitated and said, "Won't you sit down?" "There is no time to think about all those things." The truth is, bringing home a son-in-law by playing the instrument is not an act of prestige.

Ramachandra Ray's great pride has appeared. He decided that he had been deliberately insulted. In the past, people were sent from Rajbati to Chakdihi to welcome him twice, this time after crossing Chakdihi, after two crores, Dewanji has come to welcome him at Bamanhati. Even if Dewanji came, two hundred and fifty book people did not come with him. Why, didn't fifty people meet in all the cities? According to Ramai Bhand, the elephant that has come to take the king is bigger than the fat Dewanji. Ramai asked Dewan, "Do you mean Sir Ooty is your youngest?" Valmanush Dewanji was surprised and replied, "No, it is an elephant."

The king got angry and said to the dewan, "The elephant your minister is riding is bigger than this."

The Diwan said, "The big elephants have been sent away on royal occasions, and there is not one in the city."

Ramachandra decided that they had been sent away to insult him. If not, what else could be the reason!

Rajadhiraj Ramachandra Ray got angry and took his father-in-law's name and said, "What am I less than Pratapaditya Ray?"

Ramai Bhand said, "Age and relationship, if not, what else?" That you have married his daughter is—”

Rammehan Mal was standing nearby, he couldn't bear it anymore, Bisham got angry and said, "Look, Tagore, you have grown big." Don't talk about my field like that. I said this clearly."

Aiming at Pratapaditya, Rama said, “I have seen Aditya like this. You know, O king, that the person who can hold Aditya in his bosom is the servant of Ramachandra.”

The king tilted his face and started laughing. Rammohan then slowly came in front of the king and said, "Maharaj, I can't stand that dwarf who says whatever he wants in the name of your father-in-law; He said, "Let's close his mouth."

The king said, “Rammohan you stop.”

Then Rammohan went away from there.

Ramachandra reviewed many thousands of details that day and decided that Pratapaditya had made elaborate arrangements for many days to insult him. He is full of pride. He has decided to hold such a statue for Pratapaditya, so that Pratapaditya can understand how great a man his son-in-law is.

When Pratapaditya met Ramachandra Raya, Pratapaditya was sitting in the royal chamber with his minister. As soon as Ramachandra saw Pratapaditya, he slowly bowed down and bowed to him.

Pratapaditya said calmly without expressing any joy or busyness, "How are you?"

Ramachandra said softly, "Ajna, yes."

Looking at the minister, Pratapaditya said, "Have you investigated the complaint that came in the name of Tahsildar of Bhangamati Pargana?"

The minister took out a long paper and handed it to the king, the king began to read. Kiaddar raised his eyes once and asked his son-in-law, "Like last year, you didn't get a flood there?"

Ramachandra “No orders. Increase of water once in the month of Ashwin—”

Pratapaditya — "Minister, a copy of this letter has been kept." Baliya started reading again. After reading, he said to his son-in-law, "Go, Bapu, go to Anthapura."

Ramachandra got up slowly. He understood what is greater than him!

## Chapter Nine.

When Rammehan Mal came to Anthappur and bowed to Viva and said, "Mother I have come to see you once", then Viva felt great joy. He loves Rammehan a lot. Rammehan used to come from Chandradwip to Jashahar almost every now and then, carrying various duties of the family. Even if there was no necessity, he would come to see Viva once in a while. Vivah did not shy away from Rammehan at all. Old, strong, tall, when Rammehan came and stood as "Mother" there was such a pure, simple, unadorned affection in him that Vivah thought you were an absolute girl to him. Viva said to him, "Mahan, why didn't you come so long?"

Rammehan said, "That mother, 'If you are a bad son, when you are not a daughter-in-law,' who did you think of me?" I said to myself, I will not go if my mother does not call; Let's see how many days he remembers! That's it, I didn't remember it once!"

Viva got into a lot of trouble. He could not tell why he did not call. Apart from that, saying that he did not think that he did not call, it seems that there is a flaw in the logic somewhere in this saying, but he is not able to explain it well.

Seeing Beaver's difficulty, Rammehan said with a smile, "No, I couldn't come because I didn't have time off."

Vivah said, “Mehan tu baes; Tell me the story of your country.”

Rammehan sat down. Chandradwip began to be described. Biva put her hand on her cheek and started to listen. Hearing the description of Chandradwip, how many imaginations arose in his heart, how many houses he had built on the sky that day, he has no more address. When Rammehan told the story, his house had been washed away in the floods of the last monsoon; On the eve of evening he had swum alone to the top of the temple, carrying his old mother on his back, and the two of them together had spent the whole night there;—then had a heartbeat appeared in Beaver's little chest.

After telling the story, Rammehan said, "Mother, I have brought four conch shells for you, you will have to wear them, I will see."

Biva untied her Chargachi senna bangle and put on a shell, and with a smile went to her mother and said, "Mother, Mahon has untied your bangle and made me wear Chargachi Shanka."

Mahishi smiled and said without being displeased at all, "Well, it's been arranged, it's been arranged."

Rammehan became very excited and proud. Mahishi called him and took him, being present himself and fed him. After he had eaten it to his satisfaction, he was very pleased and said, "Sing this time, Mehon, the song of his arrival." Rammehan looked at Biva and said;—

"I haven't seen you all year, mother, how are you doing to me,

Nayan-star lost my blind Nayan-star!

Eli ki Pashani Ore,

I will look at you.

There is no stopping the flow of the eyes of the mother and the neighborhood!”

Tears came to Rammehan's eyes, Mahishi also looked at Biva's face and wiped his tears. He remembered his victory in the song of Agari.

Gradually evening came. Crowds of old ladies flocked to the house. Neighboring women gathered in Anthappur to see the son-in-law and mock the son-in-law according to the relationship. Joy, shame, apprehension, an uncertain, indeterminate not-knowing-what-will-happen in Viva's heart, her face and ears are red, her hands and feet are cold. Who knows the happiness of this pain!

Son-in-law has come to Anthapura. The ladies attacked him from all sides like a flock of thorn-bearing beauties. Laughter erupted all around. From all around, the sharp mocking of the cuckoo's voice, the harsh push of Mrinal's arm, the sharp pain of the moon-claw of Champak-fingers began to go on. When Ramachandra Ray was completely upset, an old woman came and sat by his side. He began to speak in such a harsh voice and gradually all the idiosyncrasies began to come out of his mouth that the mouths of the old ladies became closed in a way. Didi, who was near his face, also became silent. Bimaladidi got up from the room and left. Only the demon's mother had told him one thing. When the said ghost's mother's face was very moving, the old woman said to her, "My mother, don't you face a tree!" The ghost's mother immediately said, "And Magi, his face is dirty, I have washed so much but it is not clear!" He said and went away. One by one the house was empty, Ramchandra Ray got a break!

Then the old man came out of the house and came to the room of the buffalo. There the buffalo used to feed the slaves. Rammehan also sat on one side and ate. The old man, coming to the buffalo and inspecting it, said, "Here is the Niksha Janani!" As soon as Rammehan heard it, he was startled and looked at Praudha's face. Immediately he gave up his food and leapt like a sharddul, holding both his hands in thunderous fists and shouting loudly, "I know you Tagore!" Saying that, he uncovered his head cloth. None other than Ramai Tagore! Rammehan trembled with anger, tore off the cloak from the bed; Raised Ramai in the sky with both hands, saying "Today I have his death in my hands!" Saying that, he turned it two times in the sky. The buffalo came running and said, "Rammahan, what are you doing?" Ramai said in a bitter voice, "Please, father, don't commit brahmathya!" A strange howl arose from all around. Then Rammehan lowered Ramai to the ground and trembled and said, "Wretched, did he have no place to die?"

Ramai said, "Maharaj has ordered me." Rammahan said, "What did you say, nimkaharam?" If he talks like that again, I will rub his face on this sand stone!" Said and held his throat.

Rama wailed. Then Rammehan tied Ramai with a sheet and hanged it like a sack and went out of the temple.

Gradually, the matter has become a state. It was already two o'clock in the night. The king's brother-in-law came that night and informed Pratapaditya that the son-in-law Ramai Bhand had taken to Antapur as a wife! There he mocked with old women, even with buffaloes.

Then the statue of Pratapaditya became very terrifying. His entire being was agitated. Spitzta got up from the bed like a lion and sat down. He said, "Call Lachman Sardar." Lachman said to Sardar - "Tonight I want to see Ramchandra Ray's dismembered face!" He immediately saluted and said, "Go, King!" Immediately his brother-in-law fell at his feet, saying — “Maharaj, have mercy, remember Biva. Don't do that!” Pratapaditya again said firmly, "I want Ramachandra Ray's head by tonight!" His brother-in-law tied his legs and said, "Maharaj, today they are sleeping in the inner city, have mercy, have mercy, Maharaja!" Then Pratapaditya remained silent for a while and said - "Listen Lachman, tomorrow morning when Ramachandra Ray comes out of Anthapura, then you will kill him, you are ordered." The brother-in-law saw that he had gone much further than he thought. He crept that night and knocked on Beaver's bedroom door.

Then the two o'clock chimes are ringing in the distance. In the silent night the sound of the Nahabat, with the Jyotsna, with the south wind, is creating dreams in the sleeping soul. The light of Jyotsna penetrated the open air of Beaver's bedroom and fell on the bed, Ramchandra Roy was engrossed in sleep. Viva sits up and thinks silently with her hand on her cheek. Looking at Jyotsna, two drops of tears were falling from his eyes. I understand that it did not happen exactly as I had imagined. He was crying in his soul. The day that has been waiting for so long has come today.

Ramachandra Ray did not have a word with Beaver until he had gone to bed. Pratapaditya, has insulted him—what will he do to insult Pratap-Aditya? No, ignoring the divorce. He wants to know, "You are the daughter of Pratapaditya of Jasahera, do you dress next to Chandradwipadhipati Raja Ramachandra Raya?" Having determined this, he is lying on his side and has not changed his side. All respect is towards Biva. Viva wakes up and thinks. Once looking at the astrologer, once looking at the husband's face. His chest trembled and heaved a long sigh—a great pain rang in his soul. Ramchandra suddenly woke up. Suddenly he saw Viva sitting silently and crying. In the first moments of that sleeping state, when the memory of humiliation did not wake up, after deep sleep, the soundness of the mind came back, the feeling of anger went away, then suddenly pity arose in his heart when he saw that tearful little face of Beaver. Biva held her hand and said, "Biva, you are crying!" Viva became anxious. Viva could not speak, Viva could not see, Viva lay down. Then Ramachandra Ray got up and slowly took Biva's head on his lap and wiped her tears. Who hit the door at that time. Ramachandra said "Who?" The answer came from outside, "Open the door immediately!"

## Chapter Ten.

Ramchandra Roy opened the bedroom door and came out. Ramapati, the prince, said, "Father, run now, do not delay for a moment."

On hearing this suddenly that night, Ramchandra Ray was startled, his face turned white, he asked with bated breath, "Why, why, what has happened?"

"I won't tell you what happened, run now."

Viva left the bed and asked, "Mama, what happened?"

Ramapati said, "It's no use listening to you, mother!"

Beaver cried out. Once he thought of Vasantaraya, once he thought of Udayaditya. He said - "Mama, what happened?" Say!”

Ramapati did not give any answer to his words and said to Ramachandra, "Father, there is an unnecessary delay." See how to escape secretly this time."

Suddenly, a very sinister apprehension arose in Beaver's mind. Gamanedyat stopped Matul's path and said, "He fell on your two feet, tell me what happened!"

Ramapati looked around the assembly and said, “Gael Korisne Biva, shut up, I am telling everything!”

When Ramapati told them all one by one, Viva began to scream and get up. Ramapati hastily pressed his face—saying—“Hush, hush, Sarvnascha Karisne!” Biva sat there with breathless voice.

Ramchandra Roy said "What will I do now?" What is the way to escape, I do not know anything!”

Ramapati said — “Tonight the watchmen are on alert all around. I'll take a look around if there's any way."

Saying this he started to leave. Viva caught him and said, “Mama, where are you going! You don't go, you stay with us."

Ramapati said, “Biva you are crazy! I will not see any benefit if I stay close. Until then, I will come and see the situation around."

Viva then stood up with force. Hands and feet are trembling. Said, "Mama, you stay here a little longer. I go to grandfather once.” Balia Biva hurried to Udayaditya's bedroom and appeared.

Then the faint moon sets. It is getting dark all around. No response anywhere. Ramchandra Roy stood at the door of his bedroom and saw the classified rooms of the Raj-Antapur on both sides closed, all sleeping undisturbed. The front yard is overshadowed by the foundation around it, and a little bit of jyotsna still remains on one side of it. Gradually that too got mixed up. Darkness took over the whole world step by step. Darkness came and sat down among the classified coconut trees of the garden. The darkness came closer and stood! Ramachandra Roy began to imagine, in the surrounding darkness, I don't know where a knife is waiting for him! South or left, forward or backward? Hesitatingly one corner is being seen, in one corner of it, is there no one sitting quietly, covered with a blanket? Who knows if there is anyone in the room!—under the bed, or on one side of the wall! His whole body was trembling, sweat started to fall from his forehead. Once thought if uncle does something, if he has any penchant? He slowly stood up. A wind came and the lamp in the room went out. Ramachandra thought - who knows who extinguished the lamp - who knows who is in the house. He approached Ramapati and called - "Mama." Uncle said, "What father?" Ramachandra Roy, said to himself, it would be better if Viva stayed near, uncle does not believe well.

Viva fell down in tears near Udayaditya, her mouth was speechless. Surma sat her up and asked, "What happened Viva?" Viva held Surma in both hands and could not say a word. Udayaditya lovingly put his hand on Viva's head and said, "Why, Viva, what has happened?" Biva held her brother's hands and said, "Dada come with me, you will hear everything."

The three of them went to Milia Beaver's bedroom door. There in the darkness Ramachandra is sitting, and Ramapati is standing. Udayaditya quickly asked, "Mama, what happened?" Ramapati said everything one by one. Udayaditya opened his wide eyes and looked at Surma and said, “I am now with my father. No way - I will not let him do this! No way!”

Surma said, “Will there be any result? Rather than that, send Grandfather to him once, if he sees any benefit.”

"Well," said the prince.

Vasantara was sleeping deeply. When he woke up, he saw Udayaditya and thought that he was scared. At once Loli began to sing a song,—

"Flowers wither in the grave, Canaan flowers in the forest,

The light of day is clear, the heart is in the mind!"

Udayaditya said — "Dada sir, there is danger."

Vasantarai's song stopped immediately. He got up in fear and came to Udayaditya and asked in a whisper - "Ah! He is a grandfather! What happened! What danger!”

Udayaditya said all. Basantara sat down on the bed. Looking at Udayaditya's face, he shook his head and said — “No, grandfather, no, does this ever happen? Is this ever possible?”

Udayaditya said, "There is no more time, go to the father!"

Vasantaraya got up, walked, asked how many times, "Dada, does this ever happen, is this ever possible?"

Upon entering Pratapaditya's house, he asked, "Father Pratap, when is this possible?" Pratapaditya has not yet gone to the bedroom—he is sitting in his mantra. Once for a moment I thought Lachman would call Sardar back! But that resolution was instantly removed from his mind. Pratapaditya ever ordered twice? The mouth that gave the order to take the order back? It is not his job to play with orders. But Viva? Biva will be a widow. Even if Ramachandra Ray had jumped into the fire voluntarily, he would have become a widow - Ramachandra Ray has voluntarily jumped into the fire of Pratapaditya Ray, his inevitable result will be a widow! Pratapaditya has a hand in this! But he didn't think that much. At times, when all the events are vividly waking up in his mind, he is getting very impatient, thinking, when will the night fall? Just at that time, the old Vasantaraya entered the house, busy and eagerly held Pratapaditya's hands and said, "Father Pratap, is this ever possible?"

Pratapaditya got up and said, "Why is it not possible?"

Vasantaraya said, "Son of man, imperfect, is he worthy of your wrath?"

Pratapaditya said, "Boy man! If you put your hand in the fire, your hand will burn, he is not old enough to understand this! Boy man! A foolish brahmin without Lakshmi, who shows his teeth to fools and earns and eats, has dressed up a woman and brought him to mock with my buffalo;—What can be the result of having so much intelligence, he did not add it to his head! Alas, when the intellect is added to the head, then its head will not remain in its body.” The more he spoke, the more his body trembled, the stronger his vows, the more impatient he became.

Vasantaraya shook his head and said, "Ah, that boy is human!" He doesn't understand anything!”

Pratapaditya became unbearable, he said, - "Look, father Tagore, what is the honor of Jessohar's Rai clan, if you have that knowledge, then can you hang the title of the Mughal emperor on that bald head!" Pratapaditya's head is completely bowed down saying that you are walking around with your head in the bosom of the king. You wear the soil of Yavana-charan on your forehead. You were about to bury that dusty, innocent head of yours in the dust, but it was prevented by the irony of God. I told you this clearly. You didn't understand how big an insult the Rai clan has been today, you have come to beg for forgiveness for the insulter of the Rai clan.

Vasantarai then said slowly,—“Pratap, I understand;—when you lift the knife once, it wants to fall on one person. I moved away from his target saying that another one has become his target. Good majesty, if you have no mercy in your heart, if your hungry anger wants to devour one, let it do it to me! This is the head of your hoof; (Saying Vasantaraya bowed his head) Take this if you are satisfied. bring the knife There is no hair on this head, there is no youthful appearance on this face; Yama has sent the invitations, the appropriate decorations for the meeting have also been completed. (A faint smile appeared on Basant Roy's face.) But think of it, Pratap, Vivah is our nurse, when tears fall from her two eyes—” Vasant Roy burst into tears in impatient excitement—“Finish me, Pratap! I am not happy to be alive. Finish me before I see tears in his eyes.”

Pratapaditya was silent for so long. When Vasantaraya finished speaking, he slowly got up and left. He understood that the word had been revealed. He went down and called the guards and ordered that the canal next to the royal palace should be closed with big wooden planks. Ramchandra Roy's boat is in that canal. He specially warned the guards that no one should come out of Anthapura tonight.

## Chapter Eleven.

When Vasantharaya came back to Anthapura, Vivah burst into tears on seeing him. Vasanta Raya couldn't hold back any more tears, he held Udayaditya's hand and said, "Dada, you find a way for this." Ramachandra Roy became very impatient. Then Udayaditya took his sword. He said, "Come, come with me." Everyone went at once. Udayaditya said — "Biva you stay here, you don't come." Viva did not listen. Ramachandra Roy also said — "No, let Vivah come immediately." In that silent night, everyone started walking. It seemed that horror was extending its invisible hand from all around. Ramachandra Roy looked back and forth in front of him. Doubts started to arise towards uncle. Udayaditya, after passing through the Antapura, came to the door leading to the outside, and found the door closed. Biva said in a frightened voice, "Dada, the door to go downstairs is not closed. Go there!” Everyone went in that direction. He went down the long dark stairs. Ramchandra Roy thought, no one can climb down these stairs - understand that the snake's hole is here, this is the staircase to go down to the underworld. He went up the stairs and found the door closed. Again everyone got up slowly. All the exits from Anthapura are closed. They all met and wandered from door to door, returning to each door two or three times. All are closed.

When Viva saw that there was no way out, she wiped away her tears. He took her husband's hand and took her to his bedroom. He stood firmly near the door and said in a calm voice - "Let's see, who can take you out of this room!" Wherever you go, I'll go before you, I'll see who stops me!” Udayaditya stood near the door and said, "No one can enter the house without killing me." Surma stood beside her husband without saying anything. Old Vasantaraya came and stood before everyone. Mama left slowly. But Ramachandra Roy did not like this settlement at all. He thinks, "Can he not do the kind of man I see Pratapaditya?" There is no hope that you can do anything by falling between Biva and Udayaditya. If I can get out of this house in any way, I will survive.”

After a while, Surma said softly to Udayaditya, “If we stand here, it does not matter what happens; Rather the opposite. The more obstacles the father faces, the stronger his resolve becomes. Tell me how to escape from the palace tonight!”

Udayaditya worriedly looked at Surma's face for a while and said, "But I will go, I will see by force!"

Surma nodded firmly in agreement, “Go.”

Udayaditya threw down his northern seat—walked away. Surma immediately went away. He went to a secluded place and embraced Udayaditya's chest. Udayaditya bowed his head and gave her a long kiss; He left in a moment. Then Surma came to his bedroom. Tears began to fall from his eyes. Yad said in his hand—“Maga—if I am a concubine, then save my husband from his father. I sent him away in this danger today, he is only a mother in his trust! If you destroy me, no one in the world will believe him.” He cried every now and then. Surma sat in that darkness and called "ma" "ma" many times in her mind, but it seemed as if mother could not hear her! It seemed as if he did not take the wreath that he had put on his feet, it fell from his feet. Surma cried and said, "Why, mother, what have I done?" I could not hear his answer. He saw in the surrounding darkness, the statue of the deluge danced! Surma started to look around empty. He could not sit alone in that room anymore. Beaver went out and came home.

Vasantarai said in a sad tone - "Dada has not returned yet, what will happen?"

Surma stood against the wall and said, "What God does!"

Ramachandra Roy was thinking of destroying his old servant Rammehan! Why not, because of that all these dangers happened. He used to punish him as much as possible. Sometimes there is a feeling that there will be no more time to punish.

Udayaditya crossed the Anthapura with sword in hand and went to Ruddhdwara and stomped on it - said, "Who are you?"

The answer came from outside "Ajna, I am Sitaram!"

Yuvraj said in a firm voice - "Open the door quickly."

He immediately opened the door. When Udayaditya was about to leave, he said with his hand, "Yuvaraj, measure up - there is no order for anyone to come out of Anthapura tonight."

Yuvraj said - “Sitaram, will you also take up arms against me? Come on then.” Said the Aussie extracted.

"No, Yuvraj, I will not take up arms against you," said Sitaram with a fist, "you have saved my life twice." Balia took the dust of his feet on his head.

Yuvraj said, "But what do you want to do, do it quickly - there is no time left."

Sitaram said - "The life which you have saved twice, do not destroy it now. disarm me This lawn is my weapon. Tie me up. If not, I have no protection from your Majesty."

Yuvraj took her arms, tied her with her clothes. He was lying there, he left. Some distance away there is like a very high wall. There is only one door in that wall, that door is also closed. Only after crossing that door can you go outside the inner city. The prince leaped over the wall without hitting the door. He saw a guard leaning against the wall and sleeping peacefully. He climbed down very carefully. Lightning struck the sleeping guard. He cut off his weapon and threw it away and tied the head of the stunned guard. He had a key, took that key and opened the door. Then the guard came to his senses, said in a surprised tone - "Yuvaraj, what are you doing?"

Yuvraj said, "I am opening the door of the inner city."

The watchman said, "Should I reply to your Majesty tomorrow?"

Udayaditya said, "Balis, Yuvraj has defeated us by force and opened the gate of Anthapura." Then I will be freed."

Udayaditya came out of Anthapura and came to the house where the son-in-law's people were staying. Only Rammehan and Ramai Bhand were sleeping in that room, and everyone else had eaten and gone to the boat. Yuvraj slowly touched Ramnaehan. He jumped up startled. Surprised and said - "Is this Yuvraj?" "Come out," said Yuvraj. Rammehan came out. Yuvraj told everything to Rammehan.

Then Rammehan tied a sheet on his head and waved a stick. Yuvraj bring our maharaj to me once only. I can divide a hundred people with this stick alone!”

Yuvraj said, "I accept that, but there are more than a hundred people in Jessohar's palace!" You cannot force anything. We will have to find another way."

Rammehan said, “Well, bring Maharaj to me once, if he stands by my side I can think of a way with peace of mind. Then Udayaditya went to Anthapura and called Ramachandra. He and all with him came.

Ramchandra was overcome with anger when he saw Rammehan and said - "I have sent him away now - you go away, you old man, what more will I punish him - if I survive this journey, I will not see his face again." Ramachandra's voice became louder and louder. He really loved Rammehan, Rammehan has been taking care of him since he was a child.

Rammehan folded his hands and said, "Who are you, Maharaj?" God gave me this job. The day Yama calls me, that day God will remove this job from me. You don't keep me, I'm your servant." Saying that he stood facing Ramachandra.

Udayaditya said - "Rammamehan, what are you doing?" Rammehan said, “This stick is the way to your Sricharana Shirvad. And mother Kali's feet are trusted."

Udayaditya shook his head and said, "That means is of no use. Well, Rammehan, which way is your boat?”

“In the canal on the south side of the palace,” said Rammehan.

Udayaditya said, "Let's go to the roof."

Rammehan suddenly thought of a way—he said, "Yes, that's right, let's go there."

Everyone went up to the roof of the palace. The canal is about 70 cubits below the roof. Ramachandra's sixty-four tall boat floats in that canal. Rammehan said, Ramchandra Ray tied on his back, he will jump there.

Vasantaraya hurriedly grabbed Rammehan and said — “No, no, no, what is he? Rammehan, don't do such an impossible thing."

Viva was startled and said, "No, Mohan, what are you talking about?" Ram Chandra said — "No Rammohan, that will not happen."

Then Udayaditya went to Anthapura and collected some very thick large sheets. Rammohan prepared a huge string by twisting the bullets. A rope was tied to a small pillar on the roof of the side where the boat was. The rope ends slightly above the boat. Rammohan said to Ramchandra Ray, "Maharaj, you hold my back, I will fall down with a rope." Ramachandra necessarily agreed to it. Then Rammohan bowed down to everyone one by one, and took the dust of everyone's feet, saying "Jai Maa Kali." Ramchandra lifted him on his back, Ramachandra closed his eyes and held his back dearly. Looking at Biva, Rammohan said, “Mother, but I am going. Don't be afraid to be your child!”

Rammohan gripped the rope. Biva leaned on the pillar and stood vigorously. Old Vasantaraya stood on trembling legs and closed his eyes chanting "Durga" "Durga". Rammohan climbed down the rope and went to the end of the rope. Then he released his hand and bit the rope with his teeth, and without removing Ramachandra from the surface, he lowered him into the boat very carefully, and he himself jumped. Ramachandra fainted as soon as he got into the boat. As Ramachandra got into the boat, Viva took a deep and long breath and fainted. Vasantaraya asked with narrowed eyes - "Dada what happened?" Udayaditya lovingly took Vibha in his lap and went to Anthapura. Surma held Udayaditya's hand and said, "What will happen to you now?" Udayaditya said, "For me I do not think."

Meanwhile, the boat went some distance and got stuck. Big shawl closed the canal! At that time, the guards saw from a distance that the boat ran away. He started pelting stones, but not a single one reached. The guards had swords, not guns. One went to fetch a gun. Rammohan and his attendants pulled the boat on the wood and took it after searching for the gun but not the flint. The guards went to call a boat to follow. On whom the burden of calling the boat fell, on the way he ate a piece of tobacco in Harimudi's shop and raised Ramshankar from his bed and went to get the money he owed quickly. When the need for a boat was absolutely furail, the boat came calling. Seeing the delay, everyone began to scold the boat-caller at length. He said, "I am no longer a horse!" One by one, when everyone finished reprimanding, they realized that there was no chance of catching the boat. The delay in bringing the boat was three times the delay in reprimanding. When Ramachandra's boat reached the river Bhairava, Fernandez raised a cannon. Pratapaditya had fallen asleep in the morning. The sound of that cannon woke up immediately. He called out "Guards!" No one came. The gatekeepers fled that night. Pratapaditya called out in a loud voice—“Guard!”

## Chapter XII.

Pratapaditya woke up and called loudly "Watchman." When the guard did not come, he immediately left the bed and stormed out of the room. He called, "Minister." A servant ran and immediately called the minister to the inner city.

"Minister, where did the guards go?"

"The guards at the outer gate have fled," said the minister. The minister saw that the danger was approaching. For this reason, Pratap answered Aditya's words clearly, and the more he delayed his words, the more he became angry.

Pratapaditya said, "The guards of Antapur?"

The minister said, "When I arrived, I saw them lying down with their hands and feet tied." The minister did not know anything about the night! He could not guess what had happened, but he understood that something terrible had happened. At that time it was impossible to ask anything to Maharaj.

Pratapaditya quickly said - "Where is Ramachandra Ray?" Where is Udayaditya? Where is Vasantarai?”

The minister said slowly, "I'm sorry they're in the middle of nowhere!"

Pratapaditya was annoyed and said, "I could do it too!" I asked you what to do! What can be perceived is not always true!”

The minister slowly went out without saying anything. All the events of the night were informed to Ramapati. When he heard that Ramchandra Roy had run away, he had a special thought. The minister went outside and saw that Ramai was sitting in the hut. Seeing the minister Ramai Bhand said "This is minister Jambuban!" Balia bared her teeth. His toothy smile was called a joke by Ramchandra's audience, not horror! After listening to his greeting, the minister said nothing, did not even look at him. "Bring him!" said a servant. The minister thought, let's put this mischief in front of Pratapaditya's wrath this time. The thunderbolt of Pratapaditya will fall on one or the other - let it fall on this banana tree, save the rest of the big trees!

Pratapaditya was completely enraged at the sight of Rama - especially when he bared his teeth and made a gesture to say a joke to satisfy Pratapaditya, then Pratapaditya could not bear it anymore, he immediately left his seat and got up, waving his hands and saying in great disgust, “Get rid of it, get rid of it now! Who said to bring it before me?” If hatred did not arise with Pratapaditya's anger, Ramai Bhand would not have survived this journey! Why should you touch a hateful person even if you want to beat him? Ramai was expelled immediately.

“Your majesty,” said the minister.

Pratapaditya nodded impatiently, "Ramachandra Ray—"

"Yes, he left Rajpuri last night," said the minister.

Pratapaditya stood up and said, "Abandoned! Where did the guards go?”

“The guards at the outer gate have fled,” repeated the minister.

Pratapaditya clenched his fists and said, “Run away? Where to escape? They have to be found where they are! Summon the inner city guards now!” The minister went out.

When Ramachandra Roy boarded the boat, it was still dark. Udayaditya, Vasantaraya, Surma and Viva, came that night and did not go to bed. Vivah lay down without saying a word, without shedding a single tear, Surma sat near her and started stroking her head. Udayaditya and Vasantara remained silent. Each other's faces are seen vaguely in the dark room. As if an invisible person - call it dark, call it apprehension, call it invisible - is sitting in the room, the sound of his breathing is heard. Vasantaraya, who is always happy, is very anxious to see the beauty around him. He is constantly shaking his hand, looking around and thinking - what happened! His behavior is hindered, he is not able to master the surrounding affairs well. The whole incident seems to be a complicated nightmare for him. Once Vasantaraya held Udayaditya's hand and said in a sad tone, "Dada!" Udayaditya says, "What grandfather?" Basant Roy did not answer him. In that one "grandfather" relationship, a yearning disoriented heart has a thousand unspoken questions clamoring for expression. He has no particular question, what is the meaning of all his words? The surrounding darkness was talking to his ear in a strange language, he could not understand anything. At such a time, when he got Udayaditya's response, his mind was a little settled. While standing there, he held Udayaditya's hand and said, "Dada, did all this happen because of me?" He repeatedly thinks that all this has happened because he could not destroy him. Udayaditya did not feel like talking more then. He said softly, "No Grandfather!" The house was silent for a long time. Vasantaraya said again, "Biva, my sister, why are you not talking?" Balia Vasantara went to Biva and sat down. After a while Vasantaraya again said, “Surma, oh Surma!” Surma looked up and said nothing. The old man sat down and began to shake his head. He was waiting for an unspecified danger. Surma then sat still and rubbed her hand on Biva's forehead, but Antaryami could see what was happening in Surma's heart. Surma once looked at Udayaditya's face in that darkness. Then Udayaditya kept his head on the wall and was thinking in one mind. Surma's eyes started to shed tears. He wiped it off slowly, lest Viva find out.

Vasantaraya breathed his last when it became light all around. Then an indefinable feeling of apprehension disappeared from his mind. Then he discussed all the events with a steady mind. He left Beaver's house. He went to Sitaram with his hands and feet tied at the gate of Anthapura. Said to him, "Look Sitaram, when Pratap asks him, who tied him, you mention my name. Pratap knows Vasantaraya was once strong, he will believe him.”

Sitaram was wondering what to reply to Pratapaditya. Udayaditya's name did not bother him at all. He once decided to convict a crooked-legged, three-eyed palm-shaped ghost, but found Vasantaraya and acquitted the innocent ghost. He immediately agreed to Vasantarai's words. Then he went to the second watchman and said, "Bhagwat, if you ask Pratap, tell me that Vasantara has tied you up." Soon Bhagavata's religious knowledge became very strong, absolute hatred for untruth was born; The main reason was that he was very angry with Udayaditya.

Bhagwat said, "Do not order me to do such a thing, it will be my adharma."

Basant put his hand on his shoulder and said, “Bhagavat listen to me; There is no wrongdoing in this. If there is any wrongdoing in telling a lie to save the life of a saint, why should I ask you to do so?” Vasantaraya put his hand on his shoulder and his back and tried to explain again and again that there is no wrongdoing in this. But when a person's religious knowledge suddenly becomes very strong, then no logic will work for him. He said, "No, my lord, why should I lie to the master!"

Vasantaraya Bisham became restless; He said anxiously, "Bhagavat, listen to me, let me explain to you, there is no sin in this lie." See Bapu, I will make you very happy later, you keep my word. Take what I have, I have given.”

Bhagwat immediately raised his hand, and the money was instantly sheltered in his tank. Vasantaraya went back feeling relieved.

Pratapaditya was called by the guards. The minister took them with him. Pratapaditya then restrained his exuberant anger and sat solemnly. Pronouncing each word slowly and clearly, he said, "How did the door of Anthapura open last night?"

Sitaram's soul trembled, he said with outstretched hands, "My lord, there is no fault in me."

Maharaj frowned and said, "Who is asking him that?"

Sitaram quickly said, “Do not command, I say, my lord; Yuvraj - Yuvraj tied me to the back and came out of Anthapura.” How suddenly the prince's name came out of his mouth. He was thinking more than anything that he would never do that name, for this reason, that name appeared in front of his face. Once out there is no escape.

At that time Vasantaraya heard that the guards were called. He went to Pratapaditya's room busy. Then Sitaram said "I forbade the prince, he did not listen."

Vasantara quickly said, "Yes, yes, Sitaram, what did you say?" Adharma Karisne, Sitaram, God will be pleased after that. Udayaditya has no fault in this.”

Sitaram quickly said, "No, Yuvraj has no fault."

Pratapaditya said in a firm voice "But his fault?"

Sitaram said "No order."

"But whose fault is it?"

“Command Prince—”

When Bhagwat was questioned, he told everything correctly, except that he had fallen asleep. Old Vasantaraya looked around and saw no way out. He closed his eyes and said Durga Durga in his mind. The guards were immediately dismissed. Their crime is that if they can be tied by force, why have they come to do guard duty? They were ordered to be flogged for this crime.

Then Pratapaditya looked at Vasantaraya's face and said in a thunderous tone, "Udayaditya has no mercy for this crime." He said as if Udayaditya's crime was Vasantarai's. It is as if he is reprimanding Udayaditya in front of him. Vasantaraya's crime is that he loves Udayaditya more than his life.

Basantara quickly said "Father Pratap, Uday has no fault in this."

Pratapaditya got angry and said, "No fault? I will punish him specially because you are not guilty! Why have you come to settle the dispute?”

Pratapaditya's mind became a special opponent of Udayaditya because Vasantaraya took Udayaditya's side so much. Vasantaraya saw that to punish him lest Udayaditya be punished. He sat quietly and began to think.

After a while, Pratapaditya calmed down and said, “If I had known that Udayaditya has some strength of his own mind, he has an opinion, an intention, which does everything by himself, if I did not know that he can blow the silence away with the joy he blows, If he could turn around and kill with a hint of sarcasm, then he had no more protection today. Where I saw the feather flying, looking down to see who is blowing! He does not want to punish Udayaditya for this. He is not worthy of punishment. But listen, paternal Tagore, if you come to Jasahera a second time and meet Udayaditya, you will have to save his life.”

Vasantaraya sat in silence for a long time; Then he slowly got up and said - "Good Pratap, I left this evening." And, without saying a word Vasantaraya went out of the room, went out and took a deep breath.

Pratapaditya has decided that those who love Udayaditya, those who are subordinate to Udayaditya, should be separated from Udayaditya. He told the minister, "The wife will not be allowed to stay in Rajpuri any more, she will have to be sent to her father's house." There is no fear of being incompetent with Biva; Be a thousand, she is the daughter of the house!

## Chapter Thirteen.

Vasantara came to Udayaditya's house and said, "Dada will not see him again." Balia held Udayaditya in both hands.

Udayaditya held Vasantarai's hand and said, "Why Grandfather?"

Vasantaraya said everything. He cried and said, "Brother, he is so sad because I love him. So, if you are happy, I will spend one day somehow."

Udayaditya shook his head and said, “No, that will never happen. I will see you there. No one can stop it. If you go Grandfather, I will not live anymore.”

Vasantaraya was shocked and said, "Pratap didn't kill me, he took him away from me. Grandfather, when I am gone, back to my drinking water, I think Vasantara has died!”

Udayaditya went to Surma in the bedroom. Vasantara went to Biva and held Biva's chin and said, "Biva didi, get up once!" Shake that hand once on this old man's head." Viva sat up and took Dada Mahashay's head and began to lift his hair.

Udayaditya told everything to Surma and said, “Surma, it is as if a machine is moving to take away what I have left in the world.” He held Surma's hand and said - "Surma, what if someone takes you away from me?"

Surma firmly embraced Udayaditya and said firmly, "He can do yoga, no one else can."

Surma also had a similar fear for a long time. It was as if he could see a hard hand moving to take away his Udayaditya from him. He hugged Udayaditya passionately, saying to himself, "I will not leave, no one can leave me."

Surma again said, "I have been thinking for a long time that no one can take me away from you."

Surma said that again and again. He wants to accumulate strength in his mind, which says that he will hold Udayaditya with two arms so that no earthly force can separate them. Repeatedly saying those words, he is binding his mind like a thunderbolt.

Udayaditya looked at Surma's face and breathed, Surma said, "I will never see grandpa!"

Surma sighed.

Udayaditya said, “I do not think of my own sufferings, Surma,—but of that which will play a big role in Grandfather's soul. Let's see what else God does. What more does he want!”

How many stories did Udayaditya Vasantaraya tell?

Vasanthara started to remember what he had said, what he had done in Samuda. Vasantaraya's pitiful heart, how many small deeds, how many small words, stored in the storehouse of his memory like small gems, today he began to reveal to Surma one by one.

Surma said, "Ah-ha, is there anyone else like grandpa?"

Surma and Udayaditya went to Biva's house.

Then Vivah was brushing her grandfather Mahashay's gray hair, and he was sitting and singing;—

"Hey, gotta go, it's not too late,

Rabi fell back, his companions went, everyone.

Aye Bhava's game is over, you have come in the dark,

(Ore) Go back again and again Kahar pane chahisre bhai.

Khel el Bhavar Nate, new people new game,

Move away from heath, or you will be thrown into the sea,

Let down the burden of life, walk straight to another country,

(There) build a new home, play a new game.

Seeing Udayaditya, Vasantara smiled and said, “Look brother, Viva does not want to leave me. I know what he needs me! Why does Vivah want to dissolve the milk that was once there, has become old and curdled? I will go to hear Viva cry! When have you heard that? I can't see the tears of the beaver, brother." He began to say,

“It's time for me to go,

why hold me

With tears in his eyes

Bandhisne and Maya-Dare.

The holiday of life is over;

Take back his eyes,

By name and Dakisne brother,

Must go quickly!”

"Look at that, look at that, look like a beaver! Look Bibha, if you cry like that—” Basant Roy was speechless. He went to discipline Bibha and couldn't control himself anymore, quickly wiped his tears and said with a smile, "Dada, look at Bhai Surma crying!" Remedy it at this time; Otherwise I will remain true; I will take your place. I will put the hair in those two hands, I will whisper to that ear through the cloth of this broken tooth, and I will not be responsible if any kind of accident happens by going so close to the ear!”

Vasantaraya saw that no one said anything, then he got angry and picked up his sitar and started playing it at a strange speed. But seeing the tears in Biva's eyes, his playing of the sitar began to be greatly disturbed, his eyes began to blur at times, sometimes he felt the desire to speak in a rush, scolding Biva and everyone present, but he could not speak anymore, his voice stopped, the sitar stopped. Had to take it down. Finally it was time to say goodbye.

After hugging Udayaditya for a long time, he said the last words, "I have left this sitar, grandfather, and I will not play the sitar anymore." Surma brother stay happy; Biva—” didn't finish talking, wiped the tears and got into the palanquin.

## Chapter Fourteen.

Mangala's cottage was at one end of Jessohar. He used to chant mala while sitting there. At such a time Matangini, the maid of the palace, came with a bowl of vegetables.

Matang said, "I came to market today, I thought, I have not seen Mars for a long time, I will come to see it once. I have a lot of work to do today, brother, I won't be able to stay longer." Saying that, he sat there calmly, keeping his clothes on. "That, sister, you know everything, you loved me a lot at that time, well, I still live, but I sensed that someone else had his heart after her—can't you make that witch die in three nights?"

Mangala has a remedy for all kinds of accidents, from losing a cow to losing a husband, except that she knows how to subjugate the king's servant, Mangala's cottage! If the magician dies within three nights, Matangini lives, she is none other than Mangala herself!

Mangala smiled to herself and said, "She is not in a hurry to die for the Magi, she will die if she increases the work of Yama." Mangala Hasiya openly said, "Are there any other people who would like to throw away Rupasi like you or not? Granddaughter, you have no idea. You will get his mind back. There is medicine in your eyes, apply a little more and if it does not work, then feed him this root with water.” Balia brought a dry root.

Mangala asked Matangini, "What is the story of the palace?"

Matangini turned her hands and said, "What is our work in all those words, brother?"

Mangala said, “That's right. That's right."

Matangini did not expect that Mangala would have such a consensus on this matter. He said, "That's not wrong to tell you; But today I don't have much time; And one day I will tell everything." Balia continued to sit.

Mangala said - "That's enough, and one day we will hear."

Matangini became impatient, said, "But I will go brother." I said I was late. Look brother, the king's son-in-law came to us that day, he left without telling anyone the same day he came."

Mangala said, "True or not? is; Tell me why; That's why I say no one can give me the inside information unless it's Matang."

Matanga cheerfully said, "Do you know the truth?" Our child cannot see well with both eyes. Does he know the mantra, has kept the Swami like a sheep, he - no brother; There is no work, who will listen and say that Matang is talking about Rajbari outside.

Mangala couldn't handle the curiosity anymore; Although he knew that if he kept quiet for a while Matanga would tell you everything, he could not delay, said, "There is no one here, granddaughter. And talk to yourself, what's wrong with this? What did you do as a child?"

“What did he do to the son-in-law in the name of our Didithakarun, so the son-in-law left Didithakarun overnight. Didithakarun is crying and dying. Maharaja is upset, he wants to send Bouthakarun to his father's house in Sreepur. That look brother, laugh at all your words! What do you find funny about this? You can't stop laughing."

The exact reason for Ramachandra Ray's escape message, every servant girl in the palace was well informed, but there was no unity of words with anyone.

Mangala said, "Tell your Mathakarun that there is no use in sending Bauthakarun to his father's house soon. Mangala can give such a potion that the prince's mind will completely go away from him.” Saying that, he started laughing. Matanga said, "That's enough!"

Mangala asked, “Does the prince love your boy dearly?”

"What work in those words! You can not live without seeing a bar! Yuvraj came only when he was called "Tu".

“Well, I will give the medicine. Does Yuvraj stay with her even during the day?”

"Yes."

Mangala said, "Oma what will happen! So, what does he say to Yuvraj, what do you do, have you seen?"

"No brother, I haven't seen it."

"You can take me to the palace once, I'll come and see it!"

Matanga said, "Why, brother, why do you have such a headache?"

Mangala said, "I'm not saying that." Once I see it, I will understand what spell he has subdued, whether my spell will work or not!"

Matang said, "That's enough, come today!" Balia took the clothes and left.

When Matanga went away, Mangala started to grow up, her teeth were clenched and her eyes and stars were widened and she began to cry and cry.

## Fifteenth section.

Vasantara went away. The evening has come. Viva went on the roof of the palace. Saw from the roof, the palanquin had gone. Vasantaraya put his head out of the palanquin and turned his face once and looked back. In the darkness of the evening, through the tears, he could see the long, hard walls of the stony-hearted Rajbati, unchanged and steadfast. Palki left, but Viva remained standing there. Wanted water on the way. The stars rose, the lamps burned, there were no people on the way. Vivah stood and asked silently. Surma looked for him all over the country, finding him nowhere, finally went to the roof and appeared. Beaver held his neck and said in a loving tone, "What do you see, Beaver?" Viva breathed and said, "Who knows brother!" All life seems empty, there is no happiness in his soul. He cannot find the reason why he goes into the house, why he comes out of the house, why he lies down, why he gets up, why he wanders from house to house for two hours at noon. It is as if his house has gone away from the palace, as if he has no home in the palace. Who broke that house in one day, which had been built for him in Rajbati with various games, various joys and sorrows, laughter and tears from childhood! This house is no longer his house! He, now homeless in the house, his grandfather was gone, when will people come to take Viva from his —— Chandradwip? Maybe Rammehan Mal has left, so far they don't know where! Beaver still has some happiness left. He has such a grandfather, he has the beauty of his life, but about them too, it is as if some danger is returning behind like a shadow. Does the house that penetrates the house and the secret secret of a thick wound is smoldering invisibly, does it feel like a house?

Udayaditya heard about Sitaram's plight after being fired. He doesn't own a single penny, he has many bullets attached to him. Because when he received his salary from the royal house, his anger, because of the excess of love, left all the work and work and fell into the absence of his lover; After making good arrangements for the meeting, she giggled with joy and said that seeing Sitaram, her hunger and thirst were all gone. There is a lot of evidence about the removal of hunger and thirst, but there is no evidence about whether it was just seeing Sitaram or not. A distant relative of Sitaram's widowed sister was trying to send one of her sons to work, at that time she was always aware that if the child was employed in menial work, the child's uncle would be insulted, so she could not work in any way to protect the child's uncle's dignity. In this way he saved his honor and made Sitaram indebted and in exchange he arranged for your life. On it Sitaram has a widowed mother and an unmarried girl daughter. On the other hand, the Sitaram man is very nice, he can't do without fun. Sitaram's condition has changed, but there has been no concomitant change. The hunger and thirst of his pizza has remained exactly the same; As her niece grew older, she became more and more aware of the distension of her belly and the humiliation of her uncle's dignity. Apart from Sitaram's money bag, no one's belly shows any sign of collapse. Sitaram's love with other planets is also maintained, it is growing on edge, interest is also being nourished to the extent that it is also becoming nourished. Udayaditya heard about Sitaram's poverty and fixed a monthly stipend for him and Bhagwat. Sitaram was very ashamed after receiving the money. By mentioning Udayaditya's name to the Maharaja, he has become an utter criminal to himself and to Udayaditya. She cried after receiving Udayaditya's money. One day, meeting Yuvraj, he tied his feet and addressed him as Bhagwan, Jagadishwar, Merciful and begged for forgiveness profusely. Bhagavata man is very cold nature! He gambles, eats tobacco and distributes heaven and hell to his neighbors. When he got Udayaditya's money, he bowed his face and said in various ways that Yuvraj had destroyed him, will he get revenge with this money! He had no objection to taking the money.

Pratapaditya heard that Yuvaraj was giving monthly stipends to decommissioned guards. It would not have happened before. Earlier he used to neglect Udayaditya so much that all talk about Udayaditya did not reach his ears. The king knew that Udayaditya mingled with the subjects, and on many occasions took the side of the subjects and opposed him, but they came to him almost so little and so little that nothing special could have drawn his attention to the existence of Udayaditya. This time he paid a little special attention to Udayaditya, so the above incident immediately reached his ears. Pratapaditya was very angry after hearing this. He summoned Udayaditya and said, “Did I dismiss Sitaram and Bhagwat simply because the treasury did not have enough money to pay them? But that you have determined their monthly stipend from yourself?”

Udayaditya said slowly, “I am guilty. You have punished me by punishing them. I have given punishment to them month by month according to your judgement.

Never before had Pratapaditya had to listen to Udayaditya attentively. Udayaditya's slow solemn humble tone and his well-balanced words did not strike Pratapaditya at all. Without giving any answer to Udayaditya's words, Pratapaditya said, "I order, Udaya, that in future they should not be helped with money."

Udayaditya said, "A more severe punishment was decreed for me." But he raised his hands and said, "But have I committed such a crime that I have to bear such a great punishment?" What should I do, eight or nine hungry mouths are not fed for me, eight or nine poor people are helpless and crying on the road; But I have no shortage of food? Father, all that I have is yours. You are giving me more than necessary food, but if you make eight or nine hungry people sit in front of me during my meal, but prevent them from putting food in their mouths, then that food is my poison!”

Pratapaditya did not stop the excited Udayaditya from speaking, and when he finished speaking, he slowly said, "I have heard what you said, now I will say what I say." I have closed the scholarship of Bhagwat and Sitaram, and if anyone determines their scholarship, then he will be considered to be against my will.” A little anger rose in Pratapaditya's heart. Perhaps he himself could not understand the reason, but his reason was that "I have committed a heavy cruelty, so Udayaditya, the body of kindness, came to correct him. Let's see what he can do please! Where I am cruel, anyone else will be kind.

Udayaditya went to Surma and told everything. Surma said, "That day, she could not eat anything. In the evening, Sitaram's mother came to me with Sitaram's little girl and cried. I give something that evening, but they get the whole family to eat. Sitaram's daughter is a milkmaid, she hasn't eaten anything all day, what can be seen in her mouth. Where will they go if you don't give them something?"

Udayaditya said, "Especially, when they are chased from the royal palace, no one else will dare to give them karma or help them because of the fear of the father. If we also turn away at this time, then there will be no one left in their family." I will help, don't think about it Surma, but it is not good to displease the useless father, so that this matter can be solved secretly, he has to find a way."

Surma held Udayaditya's hand and said, "You don't have to do anything else, I will do everything, put the burden on me." Surma wants to cover Udayaditya by giving herself. This year has been the bad year of Udayaditya. All that the blind man is led to do is against his father; But that is such an act that a wife like Surma cannot prevent her husband from doing that. Surma is not such a wife; When Swami goes on a crusade, Surma ties his armour, then goes home and weeps. Surma's life is full of fear, but Udayaditya is trusted by him. Udayaditya looked at Surma's face during the danger of the blow, saw tears in Surma's eyes, but Surma's hands did not shake, Surma's steps were unwavering.

Surma, with the hand of one of her trusted maids, arranged to send the vrittis to Sitaram's mother and Bhagwat's wife. Dasi is faithful, but she does not consider it necessary to keep this a secret from Mangala. No one outside was aware of this except Mangala.

## Chapter Sixteen.

When Pratapaditya heard about sending the scholarship secretly, he sent an order to Anthapura without speaking that Surma should go to Pitralaya. Udayaditya tied a strong ball on his chest. Biva cried and hugged Surma's neck and said, "If you go, what will I do in this crematorium?" Surma held Biva's chin, kissed Biva's face and said, "Why should I go Biva, my everything is here." When Surma heard Pratapaditya's order, he said, “I see no reason to go to Pitralaya. No one came to take me from there, my husband also has no opinion about it. Therefore, I do not see any need to immediately go to Pitralaya for no reason.” Hearing this Pratapaditya got burnt. But he thought, there is no way. Surma can't be forced out of the house, no physical force is used inside. Pratapaditya was very clumsy about girls, he knew how to use force on force, but he never thought about how to manipulate these girls. He can pull and tear large tortoises, but cannot untangle delicate glands of thin formula with his thick fingers. These girls, according to him, are absolutely horrible and unfit to be known. Whenever there is a goal about them, he quickly charges the buffalo. He has no leisure, no desire, and no ability to think about them. This is a very inappropriate thing for him to do. This time too, Pratapaditya called the buffalo and said, "Send Surma to his father's house!" Mahishi said, "Then what will happen to Baba Uday?" Pratapaditya got annoyed and said, "Udaya is no longer a child's curse, I want to send Surma away from Rajpuri at the request of the king, this is my order."

Mahishi called Udayaditya and said, "Father Uday, let's send Surma to father's house!" Udayaditya said, "Why mother, has Surma committed a crime?"

Mahishi said, "What do you know, son, we are girls, we don't understand anything. Only Maharaja knows what opportunities will arise in the reign of Maharaja by sending the wife to her father's house."

Udayaditya said, "Mother, did the king's work improve by making me miserable by making me suffer? As long as I have endured suffering, what happiness is left for me? Surma is not very happy. For two evenings he has endured reprimands, far-ashes he has covered his limbs, finally did not even open a place for him in the palace! Does he have anything to do with you, mother? Is he a beggar guest, who will keep happiness, when happiness chases away? Then mother, there is no place for me in the palace, send me away too.

Mahishi started crying, said, "What do you know, father?" I can't understand what the Maharaja does. But, let me tell you, our grandmother is not a good girl either. There is no peace here until he enters the palace. Bones were irritated. That,' he went to his father's house for a day, let's see, what do you say! If he leaves here for a few days, we will see if Mr. Home returns or not!"

Udayaditya did not reply to these words, sat in silence for a while, then got up and left.

Mahishi cried and went to Pratapaditya, said "Maharaj, protect me! Uday will not survive if Surma is sent. There is nothing wrong with the child, that Surma, what has that witch cast a spell on him.” Saying this, the buffalo wept and yearned.

Pratapaditya Bisham got angry and said, "If Surma does not go, I will keep Udayaditya imprisoned!"

Mahishi came from Maharaja and went to Surma and said, "Peramukhi, what have you done to my child?" Give me back my child! Did you not destroy him until he came? At last—he is the king's son—will you not be satisfied without handcuffing him?”

Surma got up and said, "Will you handcuff him for me? What is he talking about mother! I'm leaving now!”

Surma went to Biva and said everything; Biva held her throat and said, "Biva, I'm gone, and I'm sorry you won't let me come back here." Viva cried and hugged Surma. Surma sat there. A word came from the infinite end of the eternal future and began to haunt his soul, "It won't happen anymore!" I will not come again, will not be, and nothing will remain! Such an empty future stretched out in front of him, - in a future where there is no face, no smile, no love, no eye-to-eye, chest-to-chest, soul-to-soul, no exchange of happiness and sorrow, even if the chest is broken, there is not even a single drop of love, affection. No, nothing, what a terrible future! Surma's chest started to crack, his head began to turn, tears dried up! As soon as Udayaditya came, Surma clasped her legs and pressed her chest and burst into tears. Surma never cried like that. His strong heart is broken today. Udayaditya took Surma's head in his lap and asked, "What happened Surma?" What else can Surma say looking at Udayaditya's face? Looking at the face and crying. Said, "I will not see that face? It will be evening, you will come and sit in the car, I am not next to you? The lamp will be lit in the house, you will come and stand near the door, and I will not hold your hand with a smile? Where am I when you are here?” Surma said "where", how much despair, how far away the idea of ​​separation! How far away is it when only eye to eye can meet! When that can't be, then how far! When the message is delayed, how much longer! When even if it is a mortal desire, we will not see each other even for a moment, then - then, holding those two legs and pressing them to the chest, it is happiness to die right now.

## Chapter Seventeen.

Rukmini is mentioned in the beginning of the story, I hope the readers have not forgotten her. This Mangala is that Rukmini. He has left Raigarh and lives in the suburbs of the name-changed Jashahar. There is nothing extraordinary about Rukmini. She is sensual, jealous, greedy like a normal low natured woman. Smile, cry, hold his hand, take it out if necessary, keep it up if necessary. When he is angry, he is fierce; It seems as if the vessel of anger will be torn apart by the nails. Then he did not speak more, the fire started coming out of his eyes, he trembled. Anger started to boil in his heart like molten iron. Jealousy bubbled up like a snake in his mind and began to lash out. Meanwhile, he takes various vows, performs various tantric ceremonies. He can truly understand the minds of the class of people with whom he mingles. When Yuvraj sat on the throne, he would sit on the throne of Yuvraj's heart and rule his heart-kingdom and Jessohar-kingdom together. What he can not do for this! After many days and continuous efforts, he thought with all the servants and maids of the palace. He keeps up to date with every small detail of the palace. He could also hear when Surma's face became dirty, Pratapaditya's slight pain reached his ears, as if this time Apada would die. He has performed various ceremonies for the death of Pratapaditya and Surma, but nothing has succeeded yet. Every morning he wakes up thinking that today he will hear that Pratapaditya or Surma is dying in bed. Every day his impatience is increasing. Thinking about the mantra tantra in the hearth, once I have it at hand, it will satisfy the mind. Bhabhi kept on biting in such a way that it was about to bleed.

Rukmini saw that every day the king's and the royal buffalo's animosity towards Surma increased. At last it came to such an extent that it was proposed to send Surma away from the palace. There is no limit to his joy. When he saw that Surma still did not go, he resorted to an easy way of sending her away.

When Raja Mahishi heard that a widow named Mangala knew various kinds of Tantra Mantra medicine, then he thought it would be better to win the heart of the Prince before sending Surma away from the royal palace. Matangini was sent to bring medicine secretly from Mangala.

Mangala took various roots and spent the whole night cutting them, soaking them, spinning them, mixing them and reciting mantras to prepare the poison.

In that quiet late night, on the edge of the deserted city, in the sheltered hut, Hamandista's voice began to rise, that voice was his only companion, that tireless monotonous voice began to clap to the rhythm of his dancing enthusiasm, his enthusiasm doubled to dance, his eyes no longer had sleep.

It took five days to prepare the medicine. The poison does not require five days to prepare. But at the time of Surma's death, so that the Yuvraj would not feel mercy, it took a long time to recite mantras and perform ceremonies for this purpose.

Like Pratapaditya, Mahishi allowed Surma to stay in the palace for a few more days. Surma will go away, Viva is looking around. He has been sitting near Surma for many days. Like a dirty shadow he goes silent and returns with Surma. One day goes by, evening comes, Viva wants to hug Surma more closely and hold her. It is as if someone is tearing the days away from its lively attraction. Darkness around Beaver! Everything is empty in Surma's eyes. He no longer has north, south, east, west, all the horizons in the world are mixed. Falling at Udayaditya's feet, lying on his lap, silently drinking in his mouth, doing nothing else. Saying to Viva, "Viva, I left all my things to him" and covered her face with both hands and cried.

The afternoon has come; Tomorrow is Surma's farewell day. Everything in his household was handed over to Viva one by one. Udayaditya sits calmly and resolutely. He has decided that either he will keep Surma in Rajpuri or he will also leave. When evening came, Surma could no longer stand, her legs began to tremble, her head began to spin. He went to the bedroom and lay down, saying, "Biva, Biva, call him once and don't delay."

As soon as Udayaditya approached the door, Surma said, "Come, come, how is my soul doing!" He said and raised his arms. As Udayaditya approached, he clasped her legs together. Udayaditya sat down, then Surma was breathing heavily, her hands and feet were cold. Udayaditya was frightened and called out, "Surma!" Surma raised his head very slowly and looked at Udayaditya's face and said, "What Nath!" Udayaditya was confused and said, "What happened Surma?" Surma said, "I'm sorry, my time has come," Udayaditya's voice said and wanted to raise her hand to hug, but she didn't! He only looked at the face. Udayaditya held Surma's face with both hands and said, "Surma, Surma, where are you going Surma! Who else is left for me?” Surma's eyes began to water. He only looked at the face of the beaver! Viva then is unconscious and looking at Surma with unconscious eyes. In front of where Surma and Udayaditya used to sit every evening, that space is open. The stars of the sky are visible, the wind blows slowly, the surroundings are still. The lamp was lit in the house. The puja bells in the Rajbati stopped gradually. Surma said softly to Udayaditya, "Say something, I can't see well."

Gradually it became known in the palace that Surma was dying by consuming poison with her own hands. The king buffalo came running, everyone came running! Seeing Surma's face, Mahishi cried and said, "Surma, my mother, you stay here, you don't have to go anywhere. You are the Lakshmi of our house, who asked you to leave?” Surma took the dust of her mother-in-law's feet on her head. The buffalo cried twice and said, "Mother, are you angry?" Then Surma's voice got choked, she went to speak, but did not come out. When it was four o'clock in the night, the physician said, "It is over!" Saying "Dada, what's going on?" Viva fell on Surma's chest and hugged Surma. It was morning, Udayaditya was sitting with Surma's head in his lap!

## Chapter Eighteen.

Surma is no more? Beaver does not think that why? As if Surma will be seen, as if Surma is on that side. Biva wanders from house to house, her soul is searching for Surma. While tying her hair, she sits silently, as if she is waiting for Surma to come and tie her hair. No, no, the evening came, the night came, Surma did not come again, the hair was not tied anymore. Today Biva's face has become so dirty, today Biva is crying so much, yet why Surma did not come, Surma never does this! As soon as Biva's face gets a little dirty, Surma comes to her, grabs her throat, tries to drink her mouth, and today - oh, today even if her chest bursts, she will not come.

Half of Udayaditya's balls, half of his life are gone. In every work he had hope, encouragement, whose advice was his only help, whose smile was his only reward—he is gone! He used to go to his bed-house, as if he was thinking, he looked around once, he saw - no one! He used to come and sit in that bed slowly; He used to leave the space where Surma was sitting empty, that Jyotsna in the sky, that Kanan in front, the wind was blowing like that - he thought, would Surma be able to come and stay in such an evening?

He always felt as if he heard someone's voice like Surma's. He would get startled, even though it seemed impossible, he would look around once, go to bed once, see if anyone was there! Udayaditya who was busy with hundreds of small tasks all day, the poor people would come to him with gifts of fruits and vegetables from their fields and gardens, he would ask them and give them advice; He can't do all that today, but he gets tired in the evening - he comes to bed tired, as if there is a hope in his mind that as soon as he opens the door of the bedroom, he will see Surma sitting on that bed. When Udayaditya saw Vivah wandering alone with a pale face, his soul wept. He called Bibha close, caressed her, told her how much love, finally Bibha cried holding her grandfather's hand, and Udayaditya's eyes also began to shed tears! One day, Udayaditya called Viva and said, "Viva, who else lives in this house?" Let me arrange to send him to his in-laws now. what do you say Do not be shy to me Viva! To whom else will you express his heart?" Viva remained silent. Didn't say anything. Do you need to ask this? Does he want to stay in his father's house? He has the only meeting place in the world, there - that Chandradwip, his soul will not be restless to go? But no one came to take him! Why did not come?

Udayaditya once proposed to his father to send Viva to his in-laws. Pratapaditya said, “I have no objection to sending Viva to her in-laws. But if they had any respect for Biva, they would have sent their own people to take Biva. We don't need to be so busy!”

Rajamahishi cries seeing Viva. Beaver's dead widow can be seen in the eye? Seeing Beaver's pitiful face, a shell hit his soul. Apart from that, Mahishi loves his son-in-law very much, he doesn't like it at all that the consequences of what he has done to a boy will go so far. He went to Maharaj and begged, "Send Maharaja Vivah to his in-laws home!" Maharaj got angry, said "I have heard that one word many times, don't disturb me. When they ask Vivah for alms, they will get Vivah!” Mahishi said, "What will ten people say if the girl does not go to her in-laws' house for a long time?" Pratapaditya said, "And if Pratapaditya himself sends Sadhya the girl and Ramachandra Ray drives her away from the door, what will ten people say?"

Mahishi cried and thought, what the Maharaja does at one time has no address.

## Chapter twenty-nine.

Raja Ramachandra Roy's very keen eye for humiliation. One day, the king went out on the road with a quadrudola, two inexperienced weavers were sitting in front of their cottage weaving a loom, they did not stand up when they saw the quadrudola, the king took it and lifted it up. Once in Jashahr he ordered one of his father-in-law's servants to do something, the poor man listened and made a mistake, His Highness Ramachandra Roy concluded from this that the servants of the father-in-law did not obey him, they must have learned this from their masters, or else they I didn't dare. Especially that day in the morning, he had seen Prince Udayaditya whispering something to that servant—of course he was planning to insult him, otherwise what else could happen! One day, a few boys made a throne out of a mound of clay and were playing in imitation of the king, ministers and councilors.

Today the Maharaja is leaning on the mattress and gurgling. A cowardly poor criminal is standing in front, his trial is going on. That person heard about Pratapaditya and Ramachandra Raya from some source, and discussed it among himself, and one of his enemies brought it to the king's ear. The king was very angry and summoned him. Either hang him or exile him, such a case has been made.

The king says, "Son, you have such great merit!"

He cried, "Oh my lord, I have not done such a thing!"

"Beta, compared to Pratapaditya and our Maharaj," said the minister.

Dewan says, “Son, don't you know, when Pratapaditya's father became the first king, he appealed to our Maharaja's heavenly grandfather to get him the throne. He pricked him with his finger on his left leg to make him cry a lot."

Ramai Bhand says, "Pratapaditya, the son of Vikramaditya, they are kings of two men! Pratapaditya's grandfather was an earthworm, the son of an earthworm became a leech, the son of a leech became swollen after eating the blood of the poor people, today the son of that leech has dug his head and dug his head and learned to hold the chakra like a snake. We are coming to the Raj Sabha in order of men, we are Vedas, we do not know caste snakes?” Raja Ramachandra Roy was very satisfied today and began to pull the gurguri. Nowadays in every meeting there is an attack on Pratapaditya. When Pratapaditya deliberately hurled offensive words and arrows at the face of the soldiers, the meeting broke up. In any case, Dorddand Pratap Ramchandra Roy said to make the criminal cry a lot in Azika's trial - "Well, we have survived this journey, be careful in the future!"

The rest of the council went away, only the minister and Ramai Bhand remained with the king. Pratapaditya started talking.

Ramai said, "You came walking, meanwhile Yuvraj Babaji fell on Bisham's cheek. The king's intention was that if the daughter became a widow, some money would come to the treasury by selling the hand-made iron and bala two plants. Yuvraj interrupted him. How much is Tambi with that?"

The king started to laugh, said "Bate!"

The minister said, "Maharaj, I hear that Pratapaditya is recovering from his illness these days. Now he can't sleep thinking about how to send his daughter to her in-laws.

The king said "Is it true!" Baliya started to laugh, started to pull tobacco, very happy!

The minister said, "I said, there is no work in sending the daughter to her in-laws! Maharaj has married in your house, this is why seven of your men have been saved. After that, bring your daughter home and lower the house, you have not done such a good thing yet! How, O Tagore!”

Ramai said, “He has doubts. Maharaj, the one who stepped on Pank is the fate of Pank's father, but why don't you wash your feet when you enter the house!"

Thus began the hilarity. Placing the imaginary idols of Pratapaditya and Udayaditya in front of them, they began to wound them. I do not understand what is the crime of Udayaditya. The fact that he had saved the life of Ramachandra Ray by ignoring the danger, all these things went to waste, and Ramchandra Ray began to make fun of him for this crime of being Pratapaditya's son. Ramachandra Roy is not cruel, he is a small-hearted, narrow-minded person. He is not grateful to Udayaditya for saving his life. He thinks that it will happen, it is wrong not to happen. If Ramchandra Ray falls into danger, will not everyone save him? He thinks that the thorn in Ramchandra Ray's feet will cause pain in the souls of all the worlds. He cannot think that Maharajadhiraja Ramachandra Roy is nothing to his own danger even to the smallest person in the world. By weighing the world on one side and himself on the other in the scales of hundreds of praise singers day and night, he has established himself as heavy in weight, so his gratitude does not easily rise above anyone else. Apart from that, another reason for his lack of gratitude towards Udayaditya is that he thinks that Udayaditya saved him for his own sister's sake, saving her life was not Udayaditya's intention. Apart from that, even if Ramachandra had been grateful in his heart, he would not have made the mistake of joking with Udayaditya. For where ten men are laughing at one, especially at whom Ramai Bhand is mocking, he does not have the strength of mind to shut up their mouths or not join them. He thinks, then what will everyone think?

There is still a feeling of Ramachandra Roy's attachment to Biva. Biva is beautiful, Biva has just entered youth, Biva has met Ramchandra Ray for a very short time. showed neglect towards Pratapaditya—but when he first broke sleep that night, he saw Vivah sitting on the bed and weeping, with tears falling on her face, her half-bare bosom shaking and shaking, her eyes watering with sweet pity, her two small, unyielding eyes. Shivering like Kisloya, then suddenly a feeling of elation arose in his mind; Beaver rested his head on his lap, Beaver wiped away the tears, an urge to kiss Beaver's soul appeared in his heart, for the first time his body was electrified, for the first time he saw the beauty of Beaver's newly blossoming youth, for the first time his faith burst forth. , tears appeared in the half-closed eyes, the heart began to beat. He went to kiss Viva. At that time the door was hit, at that time he heard the news of danger. The first growth of the heart, the first excitement of desire, the lust of the eye, were not satisfied, so they thirstily held on to the memory of Ramachandra Ray. It is not a feeling of permanent love, because it is not possible for the tender heart of Ramachandra Ray. Just as a gentle heart feels an immediate pull towards a luxury item, the gentle Ramachandra Roy also developed a similar feeling towards Viva. Be that as it may, for whatever reason, Ramachandra Roy's youthful dreams were disturbed. An ambition arose in him to get his wife. But what will everyone think if Viva is sent to fetch it? The councilors will think of him as a woman, the minister will be dissatisfied, Ramai Bhand will laugh! Besides, Pratapaditya was punished for that? Revenge on the father-in-law? He has no confidence, no inclination to send Vivah after thinking of seven and five like this. In fact, he does not dare to stop making fun of Viva, and thinking of Pratapaditya, he does not want to stop it.

When Ramai Bhand and the minister left, Rammehan Mal came and said "Maharaj!"

The king said, "What Rammehan!"

Rammehan "Maharaja, order, I go to fetch Thakurani."

The king said, "What is he talking about?"

Rammehan said, “Ajna yes. Anthapura is empty, I cannot see it. When I go to Anthapura, I don't see anyone in the house of Maharaj, I feel like my life is going on. My mother Lakshmi come to the house and make the house bright.

The king said, “Rammahan, have you gone mad? Did I bring that girl home?"

Rammehan widened his eyes and said, "Why, Maharaj, what crime has my mathakurani committed?"

The king said, "Say what is Rammehan?" Shall I bring Pratapaditya's daughter home?”

Rammehan said, “Why don't you bring it? What is his relationship with Pratapaditya? As long as there is no marriage, the daughter belongs to the father; After the marriage, the father no longer has the right to it. Now your buffalo is yours—if you don't bring him home, if you don't respect him, who will?"

The king said, "I have married Pratapaditya's daughter, this is enough, shall I bring her home again?" In that case, what will be done to protect the value?"

Rammehan said, “Protection of standards? You have left your own buffalo in the next room, you have no right over it, other people can dominate it at will, is this what protects your dignity?”

The king said, "What if Pratapaditya does not give the girl?"

Rammehan puffed up his big chest and said, "What did the king say?" If not give? Who will not give such a great opportunity? My mother, mother Lakshmi of our house, who can keep him from us? No matter how great the glory is, I will take it from his hand. I said this. I will bring my mother, who are you to stop?" Saying this Rammehan started to leave.

The king quickly said - "Rammahan, don't go, listen to it." Well, there's no objection to you going and fetching the buffalo, but—see—that no one hears. Ramai or the minister should not hear this!"

Rammehan said, "That order, Maharaj!" Said and left.

Although everyone will know when Mahishi comes to Rajpur, still there is a long delay, there is time to prepare for him, if he can avoid the hands of present shame, Ramchandra Roy will live.

## Chapter Twenty.

What makes Udayaditya happy, day and night is the only effort. He does all his work with his own hands. He brings his food himself, sits in the front during meals, does not allow mistakes in even the slightest matter. When Udayaditya comes to his house in the evening, sitting with both hands covering his eyes - Bhuji is watering his eyes, Vivah slowly comes to his feet - tries to speak, nothing comes out. Two people are stunned, no one has a word. The light of the dirty lamp is shaking sometimes, and at the same time, a dark shadow is shaking on the wall, Viva is silent for a long time, looking at that shadow, breathing heavily and crying, "Dada, where did he go?" Udayaditya was startled, removed his blindfold and looked at Biva's face, as if he could not understand what Biva said, as if he was trying to understand it, suddenly he became conscious, quickly wiped his tears and came to Biva and said, "Ai Biva, tell me a story!" "

Rainy day - very cloudy; It is raining all day. As the day darkened, the plants in the garden stood still and soaked. The wind is blowing and the rain is pouring into the room. Udayaditya is sitting silently; Clouds are calling in the sky, lightning is disappearing on the horizon. The incessant sound of the rain only seems to say, “Surma nai—she nai.” Sometimes the humid air comes and says, "Where is the antimony!" Biva slowly approaches Udayaditya and says - "Dada!" Dada could not answer anymore, seeing Viva, he covered his face and put his head on blanket, rain started falling on his head. Thus the day passes, the evening comes, the night begins. Biva prepared Udayaditya's meal and came again and said, "Dada, the food has arrived, eat it!" Udayaditya makes no reply. The night started getting longer. Biva cried and said, "Dada, get up, it's night." Udayaditya raised his face and saw that Viva was crying; Get up quickly and wipe the beaver's eyes and go eat. Do not eat well. Seeing this, Viva sighs and goes to sleep, she does not touch food again.

Viva tries to talk, to tell stories, but Viva can't say much; Can't think of what to do to keep Udayaditya happy. He only thinks, Oh, if Grandpa had lived!

What kind of fear has appeared in Udayaditya's mind today. He is very afraid of Pratapaditya. And he does not have the courage to look forward. Knowing the danger, they can no longer fight against the tyranny. He hesitates in all activities, doubts appear in all matters.

One day, Udayaditya heard that the zamindar of Chapra had been ordered to send sticks to the Kacharis at night and loot the Kacharis and set fire to the Kachari bowls. Udayaditya at once ordered his horse to be prepared and went to Anthapura. He entered the bedroom and looked around once. What did you think? He changed his mind and started to change. came out The servant came and said, "Yuvaraja's horse is ready. Where should we go?” Yuvraj looked at the servant's face with a different mind for a while and finally said, “Nowhere. You take the horse.”

One day Udayaditya came out after hearing a cry and saw a royal servant tying a man to a tree and killing him. The people wept and looked at the Prince's face and said, "Oh Prince!" Yuvraj could not see her pain, quickly ran and entered the house. In the past, he used to stop the workers without judging the results and tried to protect the people.

Bhagwat and Sitaram's scholarships are closed. The prince no longer dares to help them with money openly or secretly. When he heard about their plight, he thought, "I will send the money today." After that, he hesitated, it was not sent anymore.

Let no one think that Udayaditya is doing this out of fear for his life. Not that he has recently developed a special attachment to life. A blind fear appeared in his mind. Pratapaditya as if he thinks something mysterious! It is as if Udayaditya's invisible, Udayaditya's future-life is in Pratapaditya's grasp every moment. When Udayaditya is going to embrace death, standing in the last moments of his life, even if Pratapaditya frowns and orders him to live, it is as if he has to come back from the face of death.

## Chapter twenty one.

Widow Rukmini (Mangla) has little cash. He earns his living by withdrawing that money and taking interest. He has subdued many by the strength of Rupa and Rupa. Sitaram is a kind person, but does not have a single penny in the house, so he has a sincere attraction to both Rukmini's looks and silver. On the day when the pot is crying in the house, on that day see Sitaram, Divya is walking along the road with a stick in his hand with a stick in his face and a puffed chest, he will go to Mangala's house. If someone asks on the way, "How is the family, O Sitaram?" Sitaram immediately said, "It's going well! We are invited there tomorrow!” Sitaram's big words have not decreased at all, but as the situation worsens, the amount of words has become longer and wider. Sitaram's condition was also getting worse. It has recently come to pass that Pisa intends to renounce his honorary Pisa-scholarship and return to his homeland.

Today money has become a special need, Sitaram has come to Rukmini's house. Laughed, leaned closer and said—

"If Rye gives alms,

(I) don't have money in the army,

(I) have come for life, O

Maan Ratan wants alms.”

No brother, the rhyme is not correct. I don't really need Man Ratna for now, if it is necessary I will see later; A little bit of silver is useful for now!”

Rukmini immediately expressed special affection and said, "If it is necessary for you, I will not give it to you, but to whom?"

Sitaram quickly said, "No - that's it! But what do you know brother, my mother has money, I don't keep money in my hand. This morning the mother went to her son-in-law's house in Jaraghata. Forgot to withdraw the money. I will find out tomorrow!”

Mangala said with a smile, “Do you need to do it so quickly? It should be given when it is convenient. Giving it to you, not throwing it into the water?” Even if you throw it in the water, there is a possibility of getting it, if you give it to Sitaram, there is not even an iota of that possibility, this is the difference.

Seeing such signs of affection from Mangala, Sitaram's love became completely empty. Sitaram ventured to make a joke. It is Sitaram's nature to make nawabi without money and make jokes without humor. He says whatever comes to his mouth, and without waiting for anyone else, he starts laughing. Seeing his smile makes him smile! When he was a guard of the palace, Sitaram along with other guards would occasionally start a riot, the main reason being that Sitaram thought it was fun, and everyone did not. Hanumanprasad Tewari was standing guard, Sitaram slowly went behind him and suddenly gave him such a blow on the back that his back and gall burned together with the fire of that bone-breaking joke. Sitaram started to laugh out loud, but Hanumanprasad did not join in the laughter, explaining to Sitaram very clearly the contrast of humor with the keel and the relationship of Karuna Rasa. Hundreds more such stories of Sitaram's jokes could be cited here.

It has already been said that Sitaram's affection was immediately aroused, he approached Rukmini and said lovingly, "You are my Subhadra, I am your Jagannath."

Rukmini said, “Mor Minse. Subhadra is the son of Jagannath!”

Sitaram said, "How will it happen? If that is the case, how did Subhadharana happen!”

Rukmini started to laugh, Sitaram puffed his chest and said, "No, that won't happen, it won't happen if you laugh, answer me!" If Subhadra was born, then why was Subhadra taken away.”

Sitaram believes that he has used such a strong argument that it cannot be said any more.

Rukmini said in a very sweet voice, "Stupid fool."

Sitaram went away and said, "I am a fool to you, brother, I am forever a fool to you!" Sitaram thought to himself, I have given a lot of answers, I have added a lot of words.

He said again, "Well, brother, if you don't like it, tell me what you would be happy to say!"

Rukmini laughed and said, "Say Prana."

Sitaram said, "Pran!"

Rukmini said, "Say dear."

Sitaram said, “Darling!”

Rukmini said, "Say dear!"

Sitaram said, "My dear!"

Rukmini said, "Say dear."

Sitaram said, “Dear soul!”

"Well, dear brother, how much interest will you get on the money you gave?"

Rukmini was angry, bent her face and said, "Go away, this is your love!" In what way did you ask about interest?"

Sitaram was excited with joy and said, “No, no, what is he? Did I tell the truth brother? Couldn't you understand what I was joking about? Shit darling!”

I don't know if Sitaram's mother got sick, today she started going to her son-in-law's house almost every now and then and her memory about giving out the money completely disappeared! So Sitaram had to come to Rukmini almost every now and then. Today it can be seen that Sitaram and Rukmini are discussing something very secretly. After a long consultation, Sitaram said, “My brother does not come so cleverly. It will not work without Bhagwat's help in this matter."

That day in the evening it is very stormy. The door of the palace is hesitating. The wind is blowing so fast that the branches of the big trees in the garden are touching the ground. Like a broken countryside in the face of a flood, scattered clouds are flying in the face of a storm. Frequent lightning, frequent thunder. Udayaditya is sitting with a small girl in his arms, closing the door around him. He turned off the house lamp. The room is dark. The girl is sleeping on his lap. When Surma was alive, this girl was very much loved. After Surma's death, her mother no longer sent her to the palace. After many days he came to visit the palace once today. Suddenly seeing Udayaditya, she jumped on his lap saying "uncle" "uncle". Udayaditya holds her on his chest and brings her to his bedroom. Udayaditya's thought is, "If Surma comes to see this girl once! He loves it! There was so much love, can he not come and stay!” The girl once asked, "Uncle, where is aunt?"

Udayaditya said sternly, "Don't call him once." The girl started calling "Kaki Ma Kaki Ma". Udayaditya thought who answered. It was as if someone said from a distance, "Let's go!" It was as if Snehmayi couldn't stay any longer after hearing the pitiful call of Sneh's daughter. The girl fell asleep on his lap. Udayaditya extinguished the lamp. He sat alone in a dark room with a sleeping girl in his arms. The wind is howling outside. There is a sound of hesitation. Did you hear the word? The word is. The chest is throbbing so that the sound cannot be heard well. The door opened, light entered the room. Is this even possible! A woman quietly entered the room with a lamp in her hand. Udayaditya closed his eyes and said, "What is Surma?" If you see Surma, Surma will go away. Lest Surma not be.

The lady kept the lamp and said, "Why sing, don't you remember me anymore?"

Hearing the sound of thunder broke the dream. Udayaditya got up startled and searched his eyes. The girl woke up and called Kaka and cried. Throwing him on the bed, Udayaditya stood up. What to do, where to go as if you can't think. Rukmini came close and shook her face and said, "I tell you, I won't remember it now." But why did you raise your hopes to the sky once?" Udayaditya stood silently, unable to speak.

Then Rukmini took out her brahmastra. She cried and said, "What fault have I done to you, that I became blind to you?" You are the one who destroyed me. The lady who sold her body and soul to Yuvraj one day is walking like a beggar on the road. Did God write this on her burnt forehead?"

This time Udayaditya's life was struck. Suddenly he thought that I am the one who destroyed it. He forgot about the past. He forgot how Rukmini had seduced him step by step in the prime of his youth, every day laying a net in front of his path, entwining him with her two glorious arms like a witch, whirling him round and round and throwing him into the darkness of the underworld in a moment—he forgot all. He saw Rukmini's clothes dirty, torn; Rukmini is crying! Compassionate Udayaditya said, "What do you want?"

Rukmini said, “I don't want anything else, I want my love. I want to sit on that bed and put my face on your chest and get your help. Why is this face blacker than Surma? If it happened in black, he traveled all the way for you. It wasn't black before."

Saying this, Rukmini went to sit on Udayaditya's bed. Udayaditya could not stay any longer. He got up and said, "And don't sit on the bed, don't sit."

Rukmini raised her head like an injured Fanini and said, "Why don't I sit?"

Udayaditya blocked his way and said, "No, don't go near the bed!" What do you want, I'll give it now."

Rukmini said, "Well, give me that ring on your finger."

Udayaditya immediately removed the ring from her hand. Rukmini picked it up and went out. I thought that Dakini's enchantment has not gone yet, let it be a few more days, after that my spell will work. When Rukmini left, Udayaditya fell on the bed. He covered his face with both arms and cried, "Where, where is Surma! Today, who will give peace to this burning heart of mine?"

## Chapter twenty-two.

Bhagwat's condition is not very good. He sat quietly for several days and continued to blow tobacco. As Bhagwat puffs his tobacco intently, the neighbors are alarmed. Because, the black smoke keeps rising from his mouth, a black cycle factory is also running in his mind. But the Bhagwat man is very religious. He doesn't mix with anyone, which is his fault, wears a garland of Harinam, doesn't talk much, doesn't talk much. But when one is in dire straits, no one can give advice as seasoned as Bhagwat. Bhagavata never intentionally harms others, but if someone else does harm to him, then Bhagavata never forgets it in this life. In a word - what is good in the world, Bhagwat is that! The people of the neighborhood also obeyed him, borrowed Bhagwat in distress, but paid it back by selling the bowls.

One morning Sitaram came and asked Bhagwat, "How are you grandfather?"

"Not good," said Bhagwat.

Sitaram said, "Why tell me?"

Bhagwat smoked for a while and shook Sitaram's hand and said, "It's a big fight."

Sitaram said "Bate? How did that happen?"

Bhagwat was a bit angry and said, "How did it happen? Don't you have to say that too? I knew that my state is your state!"

Sitaram said somewhat unprepared, "No, hey, I'm not saying that, I'm saying why don't you borrow?"

Bhagwat said, “If you borrow, you will have to purify yourself. Shudhib what dia? There is not much to sell and block."

Sitaram proudly said, "How much money you want to borrow, I will give."

Bhagwat said, "So? If you have so much money that even if you throw a handful into the water nothing will come out, then give me the whole ten. But I'm telling you in advance, I don't have the power to heal!"

Sitaram said, "You don't have to worry about that, grandfather."

It is not that Bhagwat, who had become extremely elated with the excitement of friendship, got the hope of getting such help from Sitaram. And one more tobacco Saziya sat quietly and began to smoke.

Sitaram spoke slowly - "Dada, our food died due to the unjust judgment of the king."

Bhagwat said—"Why, you don't understand that!" Sitaram's kindness was not tolerated by Bhagwat, something was wrong in his mind!

Sitaram said, "No, I am talking about words! If it doesn't go today, it will go after ten days."

Bhagwat said — "So, what can we do if the king judges unjustly."

Sitaram said, "Oh, when Yuvraj becomes the king, then there will be Rama's reign in Jasher so long as we live."

Bhagwat chatted and said, "What is our work in those words, brother? You big man, you sit in your house and beat the king's vizier, he gets good—I'm a poor man, I don't trust that much!”

Sitaram said, "Why are you angry, grandfather? Why don't you listen with your heart?" What did you want to say quietly?

Bhagavata became very angry and said, "Look, Sitaram, I am telling you clearly, do not utter such words to me."

Sitaram left that day. Bhagwat spent the whole day thinking about something, the next morning he himself went to Sitaram. Said to Sitaram, "What you said yesterday was a very mature thing."

Sitaram became proud and said, "How did you not tell me, grandfather!"

Bhagwat said, "I have come today to consult you about that."

Sitaram became more proud. A series of consultations took place over several days.

After consultation, it was decided that a fake application should be written, as if the prince was applying to get the kingdom himself, alleging rebellion against the emperor in the name of Pratapaditya. Prince's seal will be printed on it. The ring that Rukmini has brought has the Prince's name stamped on it, so the work is well advanced.

Worked as suggested. A fake petition was written, with the Prince's name printed on it. The naive Sitaram could not be trusted, so it was decided that Bhagwat himself would take the petition and hand it over to Dilishwar.

Bhagwat did not go to Delhi with the petition but went to Pratap Aditya. Said to Maharaja, "One of Udayaditya's servants was going towards Delhi with this request, I can know from what source. The servant has fled the country, I am coming to the Maharaja with the petition.” Bhagwat did not name Sitaram. After reading the application, it is not necessary to say what happened to Pratapaditya. Bhagwat's paternal grandfather was employed in the palace.

## Section twenty-three.

Beaver has brought darkness into his soul. In the future, it is as if a heartbreaking sadness, a desolate despair, a flood of all the happiness of life, is waiting for him, every moment is creeping closer to him. That life-destroying, omnivorous, arid, boundless fear of a visionless future, as if a shadow had fallen into Beaver's soul. How is the beaver inside the mind! Viva is lying alone on the bed. At this time there is no one near Biva. Biva breathed, Biva cried, Biva yearned and said, “Did you abandon me? What crime have I committed against you?” He began to cry and say, "Have I committed a crime?" He covered his face with both hands and took the pillow to his chest and cried and cried and said over and over again "What have I done?" "Not a single letter, not a single person came, I can't hear news from anyone. what will i do I am wandering from house to house all day, no one tells you news, I can't hear your name from anyone's mouth! What are you going to spend your day with? How many days have passed? How many afternoons and evenings, how many nights the unaccompanied Biva wanders like a thin shadow in the empty rooms of the palace!

At that time one day in the morning Rammehan came and bowed saying "Ma ga jai hek", Viva was startled as if a thunderbolt of happiness had broken on her head. Water came out of his eyes. He was shocked and said, “Mahan, you are here!”

"Yes, mother, I see, mother has forgotten us, let's remind her once!"

Biva thought of asking what to ask, but she couldn't be shy - she couldn't say it - but Prana was anxious to hear it.

Rammehan looked at Biva's face and said, “Why mother, why is your face so dirty? There is ink in your eyes. No smile. Hair is coarse. Come mother, come to our house. There is no one here to take care of you!”

Viva smiled faintly; Don't say anything! Smile after smile and smile. Tears began to fall from the two eyes - tears started to fall, flooding the thin, pale eyes, and the tears did not stop! many After days of indifference, the pride that rose to the surface when she received a little care, Viva wept with that very soft, gentle, eternally loving pride. He said to himself, "Did you remember me after so long?"

Rammehan couldn't stay any longer, tears came to his eyes, he said - "A sign! Ma-Lakshmi you come to our house with a smiling face. Have tears in your eyes on this auspicious day!”

Mahishi was afraid that the son-in-law would not accept his daughter. He was overjoyed to hear that Rammohan had come to fetch Viva. He called Rammohan and asked about his son-in-law's welfare, fed Rammahan with special care, listened to Rammahan's story, and spent the day happily! Tomorrow is a good travel day; It was decided to send Viva tomorrow morning. Pratapaditya did not object to this.

When everything was settled for the journey, Viva once went to Udayaditya! Udayaditya was sitting alone thinking something.

Seeing Viva, Ishat was shocked and said, "Viva, but you left?" It was good! May you be happy. May you bless your husband's house in the form of Lakshmi!”

Viva fell at Udayaditya's feet and began to cry. Udayaditya's eyes began to water;—putting his hands on Biva's head, he said,—“Why are you crying? What happiness did he have here? All around only sorrow, suffering, shake. Escaped from this prison—you survived!”

When Viva got up, Udayaditya said, “Are you going? But income. When we went to Swamigriha, we were completely forgotten. I think once in a while, sometimes I get news."

Viva went to Rammehan and said, "I can't go now!"

Rammehan was surprised and said, "What is she talking about?"

Viva said, “No, I cannot go. I can't leave grandfather alone now. It is because of me that he is suffering so much, and I will leave him here today and go to share happiness? As long as there is only pain in his mind, I will also be with him. Who will take care of him like me here?” Saying that, Viva went away crying.

There was a commotion in the inner city. Mahishi Aasya started scolding Viva; He threatened him a lot, gave him a lot of advice; Viva simply said—“No mom, I can't!”

Mahishi cried in anger and said, "I have never seen such a girl anywhere!" He went to Maharaj and told everything. Maharaj calmly said, "That's fine, why should the beaver go if he doesn't want to?"

Mahishi was surprised, threw up his hands, gave up and said, "Do whatever you want, I will not hold back."

Udayaditya was surprised to hear all this. He came to Viva and explained a lot; Viva began to cry quietly, did not understand!

Hatashwas Rammehan came and said with a pale face, "Mom, I'm going." What shall I say to the king?"

Viva could not say anything, remained unanswered for a long time!

Rammehan said, "But goodbye mother!" He bowed and got up. Biva cried out in agony, called "Mehan!"

Mahon came back and said, "What mom?"

Biva said, "Tell the king to pardon me." He is calling himself, yet I could not go, he is only my far-sighted?”

“That order!” said Rammehan dryly.

Rammehan bowed again and left. Biva saw that Rammehan could not understand Biva's feelings, his heavy luggage was blocking him. Where Viva's soul desired to go, Viva could not go;—Rama Mehana, whom she loved so well, went away in anger today. Biva knows what happened in Biva's life!

Viva remained. Wiping his tears, he fell to his grandfather with a heavy heart. Like a dim, thin shadow he silently works all around the house. Udayaditya lowers his eyes and smiles a little when he says something affectionately. In the evening he sat at Udayaditya's feet and tried to talk a little. When the buffalo says something reprimanding, he stands quietly and listens, and finally floats away like a piece of dirty cloud. When someone grabs Beaver's chin and says, "Beaver, why are you so angry?" Viva doesn't say anything, just smiles a little.

At this time Bhagavata took the aforementioned fake petition and showed it to Pratapaditya. The minister said, "Maharaj, what the Prince has done, it is not believed in any way." The one who listens says by biting his tongue, that should not be brought to his ears. It is not credible that Yuvraj would do it alone.” Pratapaditya said, "I don't have much faith in him. But what is wrong with being in prison? There was no trouble there. A guard will be appointed only for him who cannot do anything in secret.”

## Chapter twenty-four.

When Rammehan returned to Chandradwip and stood before the king as a single-handed criminal, Ramachandra Ray's entire body was enflamed. He had decided that after the arrival of Viva, he would listen to her about Pratapaditya and his family and make her aware of his father-in-law. He had decided what to say, how to say it, when to say it. Ramchandra Roy is not a Goan, it was not his intention to harass Viva in any way. He was only impatient with the pleasure of making Vivah very ashamed of her father at times. In fact, under the influence of this joy, he did not think that there could be any obstacle for the beaver to come. At such a time, Ramchandra Ray was surprised to see Rammehan coming alone and said, "What happened, Rammehan?"

Rammehan said, “All in vain!”

The king was startled and said, "Bring it to me?"

Rammehan — “Order, no maharaj! I traveled to Kulagne!”

The king became very angry and said, “Who told him to travel? Then I forbade him again and again, when you were puffed up, and today—”

Rammehan put his hand on his forehead and said with a pale face, "Maharaj, it is the fault of my blindness!"

Ramchandra Roy became more angry and said, "Ramachandra Roy's insult! You went to beg for alms in my name, and Pratapaditya did not give. Such a big insult has never happened in our clan."

Then Rammehan picked up Natshir and said proudly, “He will not speak. If Pratapaditya had not given, I would have brought it. I went to tell you that. King, when I go to fulfill your orders, do I fear Pratapaditya? Pratapaditya is the king, but he is not my king.”

The king said, "But why didn't it happen?"

Rammehan remained silent for a long time, tears appeared in his eyes.

The king was impatient and said, "Rammamehan, speak quickly."

Rammehan said with one hand—"Maharaj—"

The king said - "Say what."

Rammehan — "Maharaj, Mother Thakur did not want to come." Saying this, Rammehan's eyes began to water. I understand this child's tears of pride. Let's understand the meaning of these tears - "I had so much faith in my mother that with the strength of that faith, I went to fetch my mother with joy, but she did not come; Mother did not respect me." Old Rammehan couldn't hold back his tears as he thought about what he knew.

Hearing this, the king stood up straight and wide-eyed and said, "But—" He was speechless for a long time.

"He didn't want to come! Son, get out, get out of my face now.”

Ramnaehan went out without saying a word! He knew all his faults, so getting a proper punishment is not wrong.

The king had no idea what to do to get rid of it. You can't do anything great, you can't even find life. Ramchandra Roy got impatient and started walking.

Within a couple of days, the news spread in various forms. It has become such a situation that if you don't take revenge, you won't save your face. In fact, even the citizens were busy taking revenge. They said, "Insult to our Maharaja!" The insult is on everyone! Ramchandra Roy's instinct of revenge is naturally strong in his mind, he thought about it, if he does not take revenge, what will the subjects think, what will the servants think, what will Ramai bhand think? When he imagines that Mai is making fun of another person by saying this, he becomes very restless.

One day in the meeting the minister proposed, "Maharaj, you should have another marriage!"

Ramai Bhand said, "And let Pratapaditya's daughter take her brother!"

The king looked at Ramai and smiled and said, "You are right, Ramai."

Seeing the king smiling, all the assembly began to laugh. Only Fernandez was annoyed, he didn't laugh. People like Ramchandra Roy are constantly busy to protect the dignity, but they do not know who the dignity is and how to maintain the dignity!

Dewanji said, "The minister is right. In that case, Pratapaditya and his daughter will be taught a lesson.”

Ramai Bhand said — "Don't forget to send an invitation letter to your present father-in-law Sir for this good deed, otherwise he may regret it!" Biya rolled her eyes. Everyone in the meeting started laughing; Those who were sitting far away, could not hear the words, they also could not remain without laughing.

Ramai said, “Send your brother-in-law to Jasher among these women to welcome him. And Misthannamitarejna: When you send a plate of sweets to Pratapaditya's daughter, then send two raw rambhas with her."

The king laughed and became restless. The members of the assembly began to smile, covering their faces with sheets. Fernandez got up and left unnoticed.

Dewanji once tried to make a joke, saying, "Misthannamitare Jana: If only one person has sweets in his fortune, then all the sweets are consumed, and there are no more people in Chandradwip who are fit to eat sweets!"

No one laughed after hearing this. The king kept silent and began to gurgle, the audience remained serious, Ramai looked at the Dewan in surprise, even a woman asked sadly - "What is he talking about, Dewanji Mahashay?" Will the arrangement of sweets at the king's wedding be so low?" Dewanji Mahashay started scratching his head.

Everything about the marriage was settled.

## Chapter twenty-five.

The place where Udayaditya is confined is not a real prison. It is a small building adjacent to the palace. Just to the right of the bowl is a thoroughfare, and to the east of it is a broad wall, on which guards walk. Cut a tiny window in the room. A bit of sky, a bamboo grove and a Shiva temple can be seen through it. When Udayaditya first entered the prison, evening had passed. He sat on the ground with his face near the window. rainy season There are clouds in the sky. Water is standing on the road. In the silent night two travelers are walking, the sound of their footsteps can be heard quietly. From the east, the footsteps of the guards echoed like the heartbeat of the prison. One by one it seemed from the past, from a distance, a cry was heard. There is not a single star in the sky, the bamboo tree that Udayaditya is looking at is completely overshadowed in Jonaki. Udayaditya did not sleep that night, sat near the window and listened to the incessant footsteps of the watchmen.

Biva went to Anthapura garden once this evening. In the palace, I understand many people. All around are slave maids, all around PC aunties, word by word asking “what happened, what is the story”, every tear drop has to be accounted for, every deep breath comes out with extensive commentary and criticism. Viva can't understand anymore, she has come to the garden. Today the sun rose in the clouds, set in the clouds. It was not understood when the day ended and the evening began. A slight line of snow appeared on the western face towards the afternoon, but it subsided before the end of the day. Darkness began to thicken upon darkness. The horizon became covered from horizon to horizon. Darkness settled over the heads of the dense bushes to such an extent that there was no longer a gap between them, it seemed as if a vast expanse of silent darkness was standing on a thousand long legs. As night fell, the lamps of the palace went out one by one. Biva is sitting under a bush. Viva is naturally timid, but today she is not afraid. Only, the darker the house, the more he feels as if someone is taking the world away from him; As if someone has pushed him from the shores of the world from happiness, from peace; He has fallen into the sea of ​​bottomless darkness; It is gradually sinking, gradually descending, darkness is gradually settling above the head, there is no land under the feet, there is nothing around, the shelter, the shore, the world-family is gradually moving away from the distance. It seemed to him that, little by little, a huge gap was rising towards the sky in front of him. A lot of things were falling on the other side of him. The soul seemed to yearn. As if the other side is being seen; The sunlight, sports, festivals are all being seen; It is as if someone is holding him with a cruel, hard hand. Vivah has got divine eyes today; It is as if the Lord has written the future of life unseen on the darkness of this all-pervasive thicket, sitting alone in the eternal universe, it is as if life is reading it; So there is no water in his eyes, his body is still, his eyes are dull. After two o'clock in the night a wind arose; In the dark, the trees roared. The wind howled far away and the child's voice began to cry. Beaver felt as if the children of Beaver's patience, affection, and love were sitting far away on the shore of the sea, raising their hands and crying. It was as if their cries, hundreds of thousands, reached the ears of Beaver through the thick darkness. Biva's soul felt as if she said, "Kere, who are they, who are they crying, where are they!" Biva felt as if these lakhs of people traveled alone on the path of darkness. It seemed as if he had traveled tirelessly for a thousand years, the road did not end, he could not see anyone;—only standing in the airless, soundless day and night, desolate starless directionless darkness, he could sometimes hear cries from all around, only the wind began to howl from a distance Hoo—Hoo!

The whole night was spent in sleeplessness. The next day Bibha tried hard to visit Udayaditya in prison, where he was forbidden to go. He cried a lot all day long. He even went to Pratapaditya himself. Viva held his leg. He agreed with great difficulty. The next morning Viva got out of bed and entered the prison. Gia saw that Udayaditya was not sleeping in the bed. Sitting on the ground, sleeping with his head on the mattress. Beaver's heart felt as if he wanted to burst into tears. With great difficulty Radan celebrated. Very slowly and silently went to Udayaditya and sat down. Gradually the dawn came clear. Birds chirped from the nearby forest. Panthers sang from the nearby highway. The watchman, tired of two nights of vigil, saw the light and began to sing softly. A conch bell rang from a nearby temple. Udayaditya suddenly woke up startled. Seeing Viva, he said, "A Viva, so early in the morning?" He looked around the room and said - "What is this - where am I?" I remembered in a moment, where he is! Looking at Biva, he breathed and said, "Ah - Biva, have you come?" Yesterday I did not see him all day, I thought, I will not see them again.

Bibha came to Udayaditya and wiped her eyes and said, "Dada, why are you sitting on the ground?" There are sheets on the bed. It's painful to see, you haven't sat on the bed once. Have you sat on the ground these two days?" Balia Viva started crying.

Udayaditya slowly said, "I can't see the sky when I sit on the bed!" When I look at the sky through the window and see the birds flying, I think that one day I will break the cage, and one day I will swim in the endless sky like those birds. When I move away from this window, I see darkness all around, then I forget that one day I will be freed, one day I will be freed, I don't think that one day the chain of life will be broken, one day I will be freed from this prison. There are these two hands of land within the prison of Bibha, where I know that I am free by nature; No King Maharaja can imprison me. And there in that room, that soft bed, is my prison.”

Udayaditya was very happy to see Viva today. When Vivah fell into his sight, it was as if the gates of his prison were thrown open. On that day, he sat Bibha close to him and talked so much that he never said so much before entering prison. Viva could understand Udayaditya's joy in his heart. I don't know how the message goes from one soul to another, if a wave is raised in one soul, what is the order in which the wave rises in another soul. Beaver's heart filled the pool. His long time goal was successful today. Biva was a little girl, she could easily understand the joy she could give Udayaditya after many days. He found the ball in his heart. For so long he had seen darkness all around him, he could not find an edge anywhere, he was totally bent under the weight of despair. He did not believe in himself; He continued to work for Udayaditya, but could not believe that he could make him happy. Today he suddenly got to see a way, all the pains of so far were completely forgotten. Today, tears appeared in his eyes like morning dew, today Arun Kiran's serene smile rose from his grasp.

Vivah almost became a prisoner. Whenever the dawn entered through the door of the house, the prison door would open and the majestic statue of Beaver would appear. Biva did not allow paid servants to do anything, worked in the community with her own hands, brought food herself, made the bed herself. He brought a bird and hung it in the house and every morning he used to pick flowers from the garden of Antapur. There was a Mahabharata in the house, Udayaditya used to read it to Vivah sitting near him.

But inside Udayaditya's mind there is a trouble. He is sitting in the water, but why is he embracing this incomplete happiness, unsatisfied-hope Sukumar Bibha as a shelter and drowning it? Every day I think, I will say to Viva, "You are Viva!" But when Biva enters with the wind of Usha, the light of Usha, the young lady holding Usha's hand, when she comes close to Sukuma's face with that treasure of love, looks at her face with so much care and love, and asks so many questions in such a sweet tone, then He can no longer hold his breath and say, "Biva, you go, you don't come again, I won't see him again." Every day he thinks, I will tell him tomorrow; But he does not want to come tomorrow! Finally one day he made a firm promise. Viva came, said to Viva, “Viva, you are staying here. If you don't go, I don't get any peace. Every evening in the darkness of this prison, who should come and tell me that the danger of the beaver is approaching. Biva, they quickly run away from me! I am Shanigraha, when you meet me, the danger of the country comes from all around. You go to your father-in-law's house. If I get news now and then, I will be happy.”

Viva remained silent.

Udayaditya bowed down and looked at Beaver's face for a long time. Tears welled up in his eyes. Udayaditya understood, "If I am not freed from prison, Vivah will never leave me, how can I be freed!"

## Section twenty-six.

Ramachandra Roy thought that Bibha did not come to Chandradwip, but only under the rule of Pratapaditya and the ministry of Udayaditya. To think that Viva did not come of her own free will hurts her self-esteem. He thought, Pratapaditya wants to insult me, so he will never send Viva to me. But why don't I return this insult? Why don't I write a letter to him that I abandoned his daughter, so that she should not be sent to Chandradwip again. After thinking like this, a letter was written to Pratapaditya in consultation with five people. Writing such a letter to Pratapaditya is no ordinary act of courage. Ramachandra Roy was always afraid. But just as you can't stop sometimes even if you have a thousand fears on the steep mountain, Ramachandra Ray also had a similar feeling!- He is always involved in an adventure, and he can't stand it until he reaches the end. He called Rammohan and said - "Take this letter to Jessohar." Rammohan said with his hands, “Ajna, no maharaj, I can't. I have decided not to go to Jessohar again. If you ask me to go and bring the grandmother again, I can go again, otherwise I can't go with this letter." Without saying anything else to Rammohan, the king gave the letter to old Nayanchand. He took the letter and started for Jessohar.

He took the letter, but Nayanchand was very afraid. If Pratap Aditya read this letter, I don't know what he would do. After thinking a lot, he decided to give this letter to Chintia Mahishi. The state of mind of the buffalo is not very good. On the one hand his concern for Viva, and on the other hand his suffering for Udayaditya. It is as if he has suddenly become overwhelmed by the noise of the world. Sometimes he is almost seen crying. He doesn't feel homesick anymore. In such a situation, he received this letter - he did not know what to do. Can't say anything to Viva; Then Sukumar Viva will not survive. There is no address for what will happen if the word of this letter reaches the ears of Maharaj. However, in such a crisis situation, Mahishi cannot survive without telling anyone, without taking any advice from anyone, seeing the bad path around, Mahishi went to Pratapaditya crying. He said - "Maharaj, whatever happens in Beaver, something has to be done."

Pratapaditya said, "Why tell me?"

Mahishi said, "No, nothing has happened—but Vivah will have to be sent to the in-laws' house sooner or later!"

Pratapaditya—"I understood that, but did you remember it so suddenly today after so long?"

Mahishi was scared and said - "That's one word of yours, am I saying that something has happened?" If anything—”

Pratapaditya was annoyed and said "What else will happen?"

Mahishi—"Think if the son-in-law completely abandons the wife." Saying this, Mahishi started to cry.

Pratapaditya became very angry. Fire came out of his eyes.

Seeing the statue of Maharaj, Mahishi quickly wiped the water and said, "So, what is the truth that the son-in-law has written that I have abandoned your wife, do not send him to Chandradwip, it is not that - but this is the thing, if one day he writes like that!"

Pratapaditya said - "Then I will make the necessary provisions for him, now there is no time to think about him."

Mahishi cried and said, “Maharaj I fall at your feet, keep me one word. Think about what will happen to the beaver! My stone remains still today, otherwise you have given me as much pain as you can. You have restrained Udaya—my child—the king's son—like a petty criminal—he—to me—does not commit any crime, indulges in nothing, knows nothing of wrongdoing, has not learned kingship, does not know how to rule subjects, has no intelligence, What God has done to him, what is his fault.” Saying that the buffalo started to cry twice.

Pratapaditya Ishath got annoyed and said, "That talk has happened many times. Don't say what was said."

Mahishi hit his forehead and said, "My forehead is burnt! What else can I say? Did you hear anything? Once beaver's mouth to drink Maharaj! He who does not say anything to anyone—he only dries up day by day, becomes like a shadow, but he does not know how to speak! Make a way for him.”

Pratapaditya got annoyed - the buffalo returned without saying anything else.

## Chapter twenty-seven.

An incident has already occurred. When Sitaram saw that Udayaditya had been imprisoned, he no longer lived idly by. First he went to Rukmini's house. He said whatever came to his mind. What else can kill him! Said, "Sarbbanashi, I will set fire to his house, feed doves in his house, and rescue the Prince, but my name is Sitaram!" Today I went to Raigarh, I will come from Raigarh, then I will take that black face of his and rub it on this hill, put lime ink on your face and send you out of the city, but I will drink water!”

Rukmini looked at Sitaram's face for a long time and listened, bit by bit she bit her teeth, pressed her lips to her lips, her fists tightened, clouds gathered over her thick black eyebrows, electricity started to accumulate in her thick black eyes and stars, her whole body became silent; Gradually, his stout body trembled, his thick eyebrows fluttered, his dark eyes flashed with electricity, his hair swelled, his hands and feet began to tremble. A fiendish curse, an all-swelling trembling of jealousy fell upon Sitaram's head. At that moment Sitaram went out of the cottage. Gradually, when Rukmini's fists loosened, her teeth loosened, her jaws parted, her brow furrowed, she sat down and said, “Bate! Yuvraj is yours. Yuvraj is in danger, and you feel great about it - as if Yuvraj is nobody to me. Burn face, don't you know that he is my prince, I can do good to him and I can do bad to him. You want to release my prince from prison. Let's see how I can do it."

Sitaram went to Raigarh that day.

In the afternoon Vasantarai is sitting on the balcony of Raigarh palace. A wide field is seen in front. At the edge of the field, across the canal, the sun is setting in a forest. The sitar, his constant companion, is no more in Basant Roy's hand. The old man is looking at the setting sun and singing in your mind.

I am the only Rainu left.

What was gone is gone, what remains is just an illusion.

I mean those who

And they do not respond,

Where are they, where are they? Cry and cry, who do you call?

Tell me, mother, correct me.

Did you keep something "mine"?

I live a life with only me.

Who knows what the old man was singing this song. I understand that he thought he was singing, but the people he was listening to were not there. Music comes to you, but there is no happiness after singing. Ananda has not yet been forgotten, but when Ananda was born, those who were able to embrace it, where are they? On the day when in the morning there was a cloud over that palm tree in Raigad, my heart would dance with joy, on that day I used to travel to Jasher to see them, will I not see them again? Once again, the mind danced with such joy, but thinking these things, looking at the setting sun in the afternoon, the old Vasantraya's mouth began to sing, "I am the only Rainu left.

At that time, Khan Sahib came and gave a great greeting. Seeing Khan Saheb, Vasantarai excitedly said - "Khan Saheb, SS!" He went closer and busily said, "Sir, why do I see your face so dirty?" Are you in a good mood?”

Khan Saheb—“Do not inquire about the mood any more, Your Highness. We are not happy to see you dirty! There is a poem—'I am nothing at night, the moon I hold in my head, I laugh together with her, fade together.' We're out of needles, sir!”

Vasantaraya said, "What is he talking about? I have no illness,—I smile at myself—I am alone in my joy—What is my illness, sir?”

Khan Saheb - "Maharaj, now you can't listen to music like that."

Vasantaraya suddenly became serious and said, "Will you listen to my song, sir?"

“I am the only Rainu left.

What was is gone,

All that is left is just evasion.”

Mr. Khan - "Where are you and that sitar player?" Where is that sitar of yours?”

Vasantaraya laughed and said - "It's not what she's sitting on." There is a sitar, only its strings are torn, it no longer has a tune.” Balia looked at Amraban and began to shake his head.

After a while Vasantarai said, Khan Saheb don't sing a song—sing a song, sing—"Tajbe Taj Naobe Nao."

Khan sang:—

"Tajbe Taj Naobe."

Vasantara got drunk after seeing - and could not sit still! They stood up and started chanting together, "Tajbe Taj, Naobe Nao." He began to beat frequently, and began to sing repeatedly. Soon the sun went down, darkness came, the shepherds came home and started singing. At such a time Sitaram came and bowed down saying "Victory to Maharaja". Vasantaraya was completely startled, immediately stopped singing and hurried to him and put his hands on him and said, “Hey Sitaram! How are you? how is grandpa where is sister Is the news good?”

Mr. Khan left. Sitaram said, "One by one I am offering my lord." Balia told one by one about the imprisonment of Yuvraj. Sitaram never told the truth. The reason for Uday Aditya's imprisonment has not been clearly stated.

Vasantaraya's head was shattered, he held Sitaram's hand firmly. His brows rose, his eyes widened, his eyes widened—Nirnimesh looked into Sitaram's face with unflinching eyes and said, "Huh?"

Sitaram said, "Yes majesty." How long did Vasantara keep silent and said "Sitaram!"

Sitaram—“Maharaj!”

Vasantarai - "Then where is grandfather now?"

Sitaram—“Order him in prison!”

Vasantara began to shake his head. Udayaditya in prison, understand that this is not sitting well in his head, he cannot imagine anything. After a while, he held Sitaram's hand and said - "Sitaram!"

Sitaram—“Command Your Majesty!”

Vasantarai - "Then what is grandfather doing now?"

Sitaram — “What else will you do! He is in jail."

Vasantarai—"Has everyone shut him up?"

Sitaram—"Ajna yes majesty."

Vasantarai—"Doesn't one let him out once?"

Sitaram—"Do not command."

Vasantarai—“Is he sitting in solitary confinement?”

Vasantaraya did not ask any particular person. You said it yourself. Sitaram could not understand it - he replied - "Yes, my lord."

Vasantaraya said - "Dada, you come to me." No one knew him.”

## Chapter twenty-eight.

Vasantaraya traveled to Jessohar the next day, where he did not obey the prohibition. On reaching Yeshahr, he went to the innermost part of the Rajbati. Biva suddenly saw her grandfather Mahashay as if what had happened. For a while, he couldn't think of anything to do. Only, wonder in the eyes, unfathomable joy, no words in the mouth, body motionless - stood for a while - then fell at his feet and prostrated, took the dust of his feet on his head. After Biva stood up, Vasantaraya looked at Biva's face with a very focused look and asked, "Biva?" He didn't say anything else, just asked, "Biva?" It was as if a faint hope arose in his mind that what Sitaram had said might not be true. Afraid to ask everything clearly lest Viva answers it! He doesn't want Viva to answer his question immediately. So he asked Biva's face with great fear—"Biva?" So he looked at her face with a very focused look. Vivah understood and Vivah couldn't even reply. His initial excitement is over. He remembered all those days when Dada Mahashay used to come! What a festive day he has gone! What a joy when he came! Hasiya would laugh, Viva would laugh but could not laugh, Dada Prashant would listen to the songs of Mahashay in the statue of Anand; Today Dada Mahashay came, but no one else came to him, only Bibha alone in this dark world - alone like the only remnant of the world of happiness - standing near Dada Mahashay. When Dada Mahashay came, the house used to be full of joy - why is Surma's house like this today; He is stunned, dark, empty today - the house will start crying if he sees Dada Monshay! Basantaraya went to the front of the room as if to assure something - stood near the door and put his head inside the room and looked around, immediately turned his face and asked in a loud voice - "Didi, is there no one in the room?"

Biva got up crying and said, "No Dada Sir, no one."

The silent room seemed to say, "Those who were before are no one!"

Basant Roy stood silent for a long time, finally took Viva's hand and slowly got up.

"I'm the only Rainu left!"

Vasantaraya went to Pratapaditya and pleaded with him - "Father Pratap, why bother Udaya any more - what has he done to you?" If you do not like him, if he offends you, then do not give him to this old man. I take him—I keep him—he shall see you no more—he shall be with me!”

Pratapaditya remained patient for a long time and listened to Vasantarai in silence, and finally said—“Khura sir, I have given much thought to what I have done—you certainly know much less about it than I do—but you have come to advise me, I should accept all these words of yours. I can't."

Then Vasantara got up and came to Pratapaditya, holding Pratapaditya's hand and said - "Father Pratap, don't you remember! Don't you remember that I carried him in my arms as a child? Since the day the heavenly grandfather handed him over to me, have I suffered him for a single moment? When you were helpless in my arms, did you think you were fatherless even for a day? Pratap, tell me, what crime did I commit that you can give me so much trouble in my old age? I do not say that you are indebted to me for raising him - I tried to repay the love-debt of my grandfather by raising you. Therefore, Pratap, I do not ask for anything from him as I deserve, never have, I only ask for alms from him—don't you give that too?”

Vasantaraya's eyes began to shed tears, Pratapaditya remained sitting like a stone idol.

Vasantaraya said again—“But don't listen to me,—don't keep my alms—? Pratap in answer to the words?”—said with a long breath, “Well—I have one more little prayer, once I want to see Uday—that no one forbid me to enter his prison—give this permission!”

Pratapaditya did not give that either. Pratapaditya was very upset that Udayaditya showed so much affection against him. The more he feels that people are making him a criminal, the more he bends over.

Vasantaraya went back to Anthappur with a very pale face - Beaver was very distressed to see his face. Biva held Dada Mahashay's hand and said - "Dada Mahashay come to my house." Vasantarai quietly entered Beaver's room with Beaver. After he sat down in the room, Viva stroked his gray hair with her soft fingers and said — "Grandfather, come, let me lift your gray hair." Vasantaraya said, "Didi, is he still there?" When I was not old, I used to pick up my hair and say to them - Today I have become old - I have no hair anymore."

Vasantara saw that Biva's face became dirty, her eyes were glazed. Amani quickly said — “Ai Biva, Ai. Raise your hair. I can't stand their hair anymore, brother. It was getting old, it was getting bald—now search for another head—I replied.” Balia Vasantara started to laugh.

A maid came and said to Vasantaraya—“The Queen Mother wishes to bow to you once.”

Vasantaraya went to Mahishi's house, Viva went to jail.

Mahishi bowed to Vasantaraya. Vasantaraya blessed — “Mother, be Ayushmati.”

Mahishi said, “Uncle Mashay and do not bless again. Now I live only when I die.”

Vasantaraya was busy and said, “Ram, Ram! Don't talk about it."

Mahishi said, "What else can I say uncle sir, it's like Saturn's eye has fallen on my house crying."

Vasantaraya became more and more busy.

The buffalo said, "Seeing the face of the beaver, I no longer taste food and water in my mouth. When asked, he does not say anything, only that his body is deteriorating day by day. I have no idea what to do with him!”

Vasantaraya became very worried. "Look, Uncle Monsieur, a letter has arrived in a terrible manner." He sent a letter to Basant Roy.

As Vasantara read the letter, Mahishi began to cry and said - "What happiness do I have?" Udaya - My child does not know anything about him, Maharaj - He is not like a king, but I conceived him in the womb, he is my child. I don't know what the kid is doing there, he won't even let me see him!” Whatever words Mahishi recites today, Udayaditya's words come to him at once. That pain is awake day and night in his soul.

After reading the letter, Basant Roy was completely surprised - he sat silently and began to shake his head. After some time, Vasantaraya asked Mahishi, "Who did you show the letter to, mother?"

Mahishi said, "If your majesty hears about this letter, will you protect it, and will your wife survive if it happens!"

Vasantarai said, "Well done. Do not show this letter to anyone else, wife. You send Viva to her father-in-law's house soon. Don't even think about the humiliation!”

Mahishi said - "I thought the same. I don't care about respect, I just want my wife to be happy. Only fear lest they neglect Vivah.”

Vasantaraya said, - "Viva will not be taken care of! Viva is the treasure of carelessness! Bibha will be loved wherever she goes. Where is the idol of Aman Lakshmi and Sena! Ramachandra has written this letter only because he is angry with you, if you send it again, his anger will subside!” Vasantaraya understood this in his simple heart with simple intellect. Buffalo also understood that!

Vasantaraya said, "State at home that Ramachandra has written a letter requesting to send Bibha to Chandradwip." Then Bibha will surely not hesitate to go there again."

## Section thirty-nine.

Vasantarai is sitting alone outside in the evening. At that time Sitaram came and bowed down to him.

Vasantaraya asked him - "Ki Sitaram, what's up?"

Sitaram said, "I will tell you later, you will have to come with me."

Vasantaraya said, "Why, where is Sitaram?"

Sitaram then came near and sat. What did he say in a whisper? Vasantaraya widened his eyes and said, "Is it true?"

Sitaram said, "Yes majesty."

Vasantaraya hesitated a lot in his mind. He said - "Shouldn't we go now?"

Sitaram—“Ajna Ha!”

Vasantarai—"Won't you come to see Viva once?"

Sitaram—"Order—no—no more time!"

Vasantaraya - "Where to go?"

Sitaram — "Come with me, I'll take you."

Vasantaraya stood up and said - "Why don't you come and meet Biva once?"

Sitaram — “Do not command, Maharaj! If you are late, all will be lost!”

Vasantaraya quickly said, "But no work—no work!" Both went.

He went a little further and said, "Isn't it okay if you delay a little?"

Sitaram — "No, my lord, there will be danger!"

Saying "Durga Ball" Vasantara went out of the palace.

Udayaditya does not know that Vasantaraya has come. Viva did not tell him. Why, when there was no possibility of meeting between the two, this news would have caused him distress. Bibha leaves the jail after evening. Udayaditya reads a Sanskrit book with a lamp. The wind is blowing through the window, the dim flame of the lamp is flickering, the letters are not clearly visible. Moths come and fall on the lamp. One by one the lamp is going out. Once the wind blew—the lamp went out. Udayaditya jumped up and sat on his bed. How many thoughts came one by one. Beaver came to mind. Today Viva came late, some mornings left. Today Viva had seen some special bath;—so he was discussing in his heart. As if he has no one else in the world - all day he sees no one but wife - wife is his only concern. Biva's every smile and every word is stored in his mind - just as a thirsty person enjoys every drop of his drink, so he enjoys even the slightest trace of Biva's love in his heart. Today, this Bijan was lying alone in a small dark room, thinking of the dim face of Beaver, the idol of love. Sitting in that darkness, he once thought — “Is the beaver gradually getting bored? Does he not like to serve a gloomy dark idol in this dreary prison? Will he gradually see me as an obstacle to his happiness - a thorn in his family path? Today has come late—tomorrow may come even more late—after that a day or so I am sitting all day when will Vivah come—afternoon—evening—night came, Vivah did not come again!—after that maybe Vivah will come. No.” The more this thought began to dawn on Udayaditya, the more his mind began to cry—what a terrible emptiness he saw around his fantasy-realm. A day will come when Vivah will see him with her loveless eyes as the thorn of her happiness—just a glimpse of that distant fantasy, and his heart was suddenly troubled. Once thought "I am terribly selfish! I love Bibha and I am making her enmity, no enemy can break her.” Vows again and again not to rely on Biva—but whenever he imagines losing Biva, the ball goes away in his mind, he falls on a cold rock—like a dying man clinging desperately to Biva's imaginary figure.

At that time, there was a loud noise outside saying "fire - fire". Udayaditya's chest heaved—hundreds of voices rose in unison outside, at once the swift footsteps of hundreds of people were heard in the sky, accompanied by various cries of distress. Udayaditya realized that there was a fire somewhere near the palace. For a long time the confusion continued—his mind became very impatient. Suddenly the door of his prison was opened. Someone entered his dark house—he asked startled—“Who is it?”

He replied, “I am Sitaram, you come out.”

Udayaditya said—"Why?"

Sitaram said — "Yuvraj's prison is on fire, come out quickly!" Balia caught him and almost carried him outside the prison.

Today, after many days, Udayaditya came to the open space—suddenly he could see the sky above his head, and the wind seemed to stretch out his broad bosom and embrace him. The eye barrier was opened from all around. On that dark night, under the gaze of countless stars in the sky, standing on the soft grass in the wide field, suddenly an immense indescribable joy arose in his mind. After being silent for a while in that joy, he asked Sitaram - "What shall I do, where shall I go?" He was locked in a narrow place for many days, he did not return - today he came to this wide field and asked Sitaram helplessly "What should I do?" Where shall I go?” Sitaram said — “Come, come with me!”

Meanwhile, the fire is burning. In the evening, some people came to offer something to the chief functionaries. They were sitting together in the palace courtyard—they were the first to catch fire. There was a long row of cottages near the prison for the guards to live in—that's where they kept their furniture, utensils, clothing, and everything. On getting the news of the fire, all the guards who could run away, those who could not, started flailing their arms and legs. There were two guards at Udayaditya's gate too, but there was no need to keep a tight guard there. Dastur said they were only guarding. For Udayaditya sat in his house so calmly that it was not felt that he would ever try to escape or that he would want to escape. Because of this, the guards at his door were the first to run. It started from night, the fire would not take - someone started to remove the paper, someone started to pour water, someone started to walk around doing nothing but making noise; After the fire was extinguished, they were the ones who got the most joy. While everyone is busy like this, a woman rushes in among them, she wants to say something - but who listens to her? Some abused him, some pushed him away - no one listened to him. The one who heard said, "Yuvaraj ran away, what do I want, yours or what?" That Dayal Singh knows—I can't go anywhere now that my house has been destroyed.”

Saying that he went into the crowd. Having been repeatedly resisted in this way, the woman became very furious. One of the people he found in front of him grabbed him and said - "Burning face, have you eaten the head of the eye?" Do the king's job, he does not know? I will tell the king tomorrow that I will put a thorn on your ground, but I will let you go. Yuvraj ran away!”

"Well done—what's up with that?" He beat him well, saying—this man was one of those who had set fire to the house. After being beaten, the woman's figure became very fierce - like an angry tigress, her two eyes started to burn, her hair became swollen; He started gnashing his teeth, his face looked like a ghost with the glow of the flames falling on his face. A piece of wood was burning in front of him, he picked it up, his hand was burnt, but he did not drop it, he took the burning wood and ran behind him. Unable to catch anything, he threw the stick at him.

## Chapter thirty.

Sitaram took Yuvraj with him to the bank of the canal; A big boat was moored there, both of them went and stood in front of that boat. Seeing them, a person quickly came out of the boat and said, "Dada, have you come?" Udayaditya was startled—that ever-familiar voice, that voice that intertwines with the memories of childhood, the joys of youth with the sorrows—as much happiness as there is in the world, as much joy as that voice is inseparable with Tahari! One day, in the late night in the prison, sitting with a sad look, he suddenly woke up hearing the voice like a flute in his dream - that voice! Vasantara came and embraced him without breaking his surprise. Both eyes filled with steam. Both of them sat down on the grass there. After a long time, Udayaditya said, "Dada Mahashay!" Vasantarai said, "What a grandpa!" Nothing else was said. Again, after a long time, Udayaditya looked around, looked at the sky, looked at Vasantarai's face and said in a longing voice - "Grandpa, today I have got freedom, - I have got you, what is left of my happiness?" How long will this moment last?" After some time, Sitaram raised his hand and said - "Yuvaraj, get in the boat."

Yuvraj was shocked and said - "Why, why in a boat?"

Sitaram said - "If not, the guards will come again now."

Surprised, Udayaditya asked Vasantaraya, "Grandfather, are we running away?"

Vasantaraya held Udayaditya's hand and said, "Yes, brother, I am going to steal you away!" This stone-hearted land—those who do not love him! You deer-child dwell in the kingdom of pain—I will hide you in the soul, there you will be safe!” Balia pulled Udayaditya close to her chest - as if she wanted to take him away from the harsh world and bind him in the realm of love.

Udayaditya thought for a long time and said, "No, Grandfather, I cannot escape."

Vasantarai said, "Why, grandfather, have you forgotten this old man?"

Udayaditya said, "I will go - once I hold my father's feet and beg for alms, maybe he will agree to go to Raigarh."

Vasantaraya got up restlessly and said, "Dada, listen to me — there is Jasne, he is trying in vain."

Udayaditya sighed and said—“But go—I go back to prison.”

Basantara pressed her hand and said, "How can I go, what I see." I will not let go.”

Udayaditya said, “Dada sir, why are you calling for danger by taking this unfortunate person. Is there any possibility of Tilak peace where I live?”

Vasantaraya said - "Dada's wife became a prisoner for him. At this young age, will he spoil all the happiness of his life?" Vasantaraya's eyes began to water.

Then Udayaditya hurriedly said, "Let's go, grandfather." He looked at Sitaram and said, "Sitaram, I want to send three letters to the palace."

Sitaram said - "There is a pen in the boat, I am bringing it." Write quickly, there is not much time."

Udayaditya begged his father for forgiveness. He wrote to his mother: "Mother, you have never been happy by making me proud. Rest assured this time, mother—I am going to Dada Mahashaya, there I will be happy, in love, you will have no reason to worry.” He wrote to Biva "Long Live - what else can I write to you - may you be born happily - go to Swamigriha and find a happy family and forget all the sorrows and pains!" Udayaditya's eyes filled with tears. Sitaram sent the letter three times to the palace by a bearded man. Everyone was getting into the boat - at that time they saw a person coming towards them. Sitaram was startled and said, "Here comes the Dakini!" Gradually, Rukmini came closer. His hair is yellow - his region has fallen, his eyes like burning embers are emitting two fires - impatient with the pain of his repeatedly resisted desire, insatiable revenge-instinct, he wants to tear everyone in front of him and tear him to pieces to satisfy his rage! Where the guards were putting out the fire, he rushed into the palace like a madman, impatient with rage—trying again and again without success to enter Pratapaditya's room at all, the guards beat him and drove him away as if he were a madman. Unsettled by pain, he runs away from the palace. Like a tigress she tried to pounce on Udayaditya. Sitaram came in between - screaming, he jumped on Sitaram, clasped him with both hands - immediately Sitaram screamed, the bearded sailors came quickly and forcibly took Rukmini away. Just as a suicidal scorpion starts to sting its entire body, it impatiently scratched its chest with its fingernails, tore its hair and shouted, "Nothing happened, nothing happened - here I am dead, the sin of wife-killing will be yours." In that dark night, this curse was echoed from side to side. In a moment, Rukmini jumped into the water due to the electric current. The water in the canal was very high during the rainy season - it was not clear where it sank. Blood was falling from Sitaram's shoulder, the sheet was wet with water and he was crying. He went closer and saw that sweat spots appeared on Udayaditya's forehead, his hands and feet became cold, he almost fainted - even in the spring, he seemed disorientated and surprised; The guards caught both of them and took them to the boat and immediately left the boat. Sitaram was frightened and said, "What a bad thing during the journey!"

## Chapter thirty-one.

When Udayaditya's boat crossed the canal and reached the river, Sitaram got down from the boat and returned to the city. When he arrived, he asked for his room from the prince.

Udayaditya's three letters were sent to Sitaram Palace by a man, but he was secretly specially forbidden to hand over the letters to anyone. Coming back to the palace from the boat, Sitaram took the letter back somewhere. He kept only the letters of Mahishi and Beaver and destroyed the rest of the letters.

Then the fire has spread further. A lot of people get out of bed at night to see the joke. Nirbbana is being disturbed in it and the book is not beneficial.

It goes without saying that Sitaram had a hand in this fire. He accomplished this feat with the help of some subjects and palace servants who were addicted to Udayaditya. In the evening five or six houses caught fire for no reason, this is not the work of God, even after trying so hard to put out the fire, there is a reason for it. Among those who have joined in extinguishing the fire, there are two each of Sitaram's people. Where there is no fire, they pour water, they do not go to fetch water, they break the pot by trick, it falls on his neck in a mess. The fire will not take anymore.

Meanwhile, while this commotion was going on, Sitaram's men set Udayaditya's empty prison on fire. One by one, windows, doors, hinges, frames, frames, wooden fences etc. were on fire. In that prison, which can catch fire from any sources, it is invisible even in everyone's dreams, so no one paid attention to it. Sitaram came back and saw that the fire had caught quite well. Sitaram somehow threw some skulls and Udayaditya's sword into Udayaditya's room.

Meanwhile, those who were putting out the fire in the watch-house suddenly heard a scream from the direction of the prison. Everyone was shocked and said in one word - "What the hell!" Someone came running and said — “Hey, the Prince's house is on fire!” The guards' blood turned to water, the kind lion's head turned. The pitcher fell from his hand, and the paper fell to the ground. At that time, another person came running from that direction and said; - "Yuvaraj was heard shouting from inside the prison!" - Before he could finish his speech, Sitaram came running and said - "Oh come quickly! The roof of the Yuvraj's house has collapsed, and he cannot be found.” Everyone rushed towards the prince's prison. He went and found the house in ruins - there was fire all around - there was no way to enter the house. Then they stood there and blamed each other. By whose carelessness this incident happened, everyone was inclined to decide. A fierce dispute broke out, they started abusing each other, even a fight broke out.

Sitaram thought that Yuvraj has died in a house fire, he will be able to rest assured for a few days after reporting this news. When he saw that the house was on fire, he tied a sheet on his head and went towards his cottage in joy; He came far from the palace. It was late at night, there were no people on the road, the leaves of the bamboo trees were rustling all around and the southern wind was blowing occasionally;— Sitaram's sweet soul was exultant, he sang a sweet song. The lone Panth walked along that desolate road, singing with joy. After some distance, a thought appeared in his mind. He thought that his family would have to flee from Jessohar, so he should not save some money without effort. Mangala Peramukhi is dead—Balai is gone—Let her go home once—Betty has a lot of money—There is no one in her household—If I don't take that money, someone else will take it,—What's the point, let's try and see! Sitaram walked in front of Rukmini's house with seven and five thoughts like this - sang again in his cheerful heart. On the way, he saw an Abhisarini. All these things cannot escape Sitaram's eyes. An inevitable impulse arose in his mind to crack a couple of jokes—but, finding no time, he stifled the impulse and hummed along.

Sitaram went near Rukmini's cottage and saw that the door was open. Heartily entered the cottage and inspected the surroundings once. Deep darkness, nothing can be seen. He looked around once. One tripped over the ark and fell, two hit their heads on the wall. Sitaram's face began to tremble. It seemed that someone was in the house. Whose breathing is being heard - slowly went to the next room. Gia saw light coming from Rukmini's bedroom. Sitaram was very happy thinking that the lamp was still burning. Rushed towards that room. And who! Who is sitting at home! A woman sitting quietly with a sad look is trembling. The half-covered body is covered with wet clothes, water is dripping through the hair. His teeth are chattering with trembling. Only one lamp is burning in the room. The faint light of the lamp falls on her pale face—behind her a very large shadow falls on the wall. There was nothing in the house—only that Panshu Mukhshri—that long shadow and a great silence! Sitaram's body froze as soon as he entered the room. I saw that Mangala was sitting in the dim light, messy hair, wet clothes. Seeing her immediately, she thought she was a ghost. Sitaram didn't dare to move forward - he couldn't even turn back with confidence! Sitaram was not exactly timid; After standing in a daze for a while, he finally said with a kind of outward courage and verbal mockery—“Where are you from! Magi, he is not dead! Rukmini sighed and looked at Sitaram's face for a while - then Sitaram's soul came to her voice and started humming. Finally, Rukmini suddenly said, "That's it! They were not yet destroyed; And I will die!” He stood up and waved his hand and said, "I have come back from the door of Yama! First, I will bathe him and Yuvraj in the oven, take two lumps of ashes from your oven and smear them on the body, then I will satisfy Yama's sadh - before that I have no place in Yamala."

Hearing Rukmini's voice, Sitaram became very brave. He always shows great affection and tries to get along with Rukmini. had to do Not that he came too close, he came relatively close and said in a soft voice, "Mairi brother, that's why you got angry! I can't understand what is wrong with you! Balat Mangala, what I did to him! Why so unhappy with the subordinate? Did you understand brother? Shall I sing that song?”

The more Sitaram feigned affection, the more Rukmini began to swell—her head started to burn with anger—if Sitaram had been her own hair, she would have torn it out with both hands, if Sitaram had been her own eyes, she would have immediately plucked them out with her nails. Diya could throw porridge. Looked around, found nothing at hand! He put it on his teeth and said, "A little rose; "I am shaving your head," he said, trembling, and went to the next room in search of the bundle. This happened for a while - Sitaram had put up a metaphorical proposal to die by tying a sheet around his neck, but seeing Rukmini's face, his metaphor changed, and he realized that he could not yet be ready to die from the blow of Satyakara's stick - he took a break for this purpose and immediately retreated outside the cottage. Rukmini came to the empty house with her left hand and repeatedly hit Sitaram on the floor of the house.

Rukmini is now “desperate”. At the prince's conduct his anger was broken at once—all his means and all his purposes were at once overthrown. Now Rukshmini no longer has that sharp smile, no more lightning sarcasm, she has no more wave-excitement of Janhvi in ​​the month of Vadra - all the servants of the palace who used to come to her, quarreled with them and separated them by insulting them. Dewanji's elder son had come to play a joke with him that day in Pan Chibai, Rukmini chased him away. Now no one can approach him. Everyone in the neighborhood is afraid of him.

Sitaram came out of the cottage and thought - the story of Mangala Yuvraj's escape is known to all. Therefore, everything will be exposed by this - Why did not I come to kill the destroyer! Be that as it may, I do not wish to stay a moment longer in Jashahr. I run away now. That night, Sitaram and his family fled to Raigarh leaving Jasher.

At the end of the night, the clouds started to rain and the fire gradually went out. The news of Yuvraj's death reached Pratapaditya. Hearing this, Pratapaditya immediately came to his palace outside and sat down. The guards were called, the minister came, and two councilors came. One testified that he saw Yuvraj through the window while the fire was burning. And some people said that they could hear the shouts of the prince. Another brought from the prince's house the remains of his molten burnt talair. Pratapaditya asked - "Where is the foot?" Rajbati searched and did not find him. Someone said—"He was also in prison when the fire broke out." Someone said - "No, at night he got the news that Yuvraj had died in a house fire and he immediately left Yasha after hearing it." While Pratapaditya was thus sitting in the meeting and listening to the testimony of all, a noise arose at the door of the house. A woman wants to enter the room, but the guards prevent her. Hearing this, Pratapaditya ordered to bring him home. A guard brought Rukmini with him. The king asked him - "What do you want?" He waved his hand and said loudly, “I want nothing more—I want to see those guards of yours, all of them rotted in garda for six months and fed on sticks. Do they respect you, or fear you!” Hearing this, the guards from all around shouted. Rukmini turned back and rolled her eyes and said with a sharp scolding, "Shut up Minsera." Yesterday, when I held your feet in my hands and told you step by step - that your prince is running away with the old king of Raigarh - then they did not listen to my words? Serve the king's house, you have become very proud, you have seen the five legs of the snake! The ant's wings rise and die!"

Pratapaditya said, "Tell me everything that happened."

Rukmini said, "What else can I say! Your prince eloped with the old king last night.”

Pratapaditya asked, "Do you know who set fire to the house?"

Rukmini said — “I don't know anymore! That is your Sitaram. With your prince who is his elder sister—and no one else is his nobody, Sitaram is his everything. All this is the work of that Sitavam. The old king, Sitaram, and your prince, these three have consulted together and done this—I tell you clearly!”

Pratapaditya was stunned for a long time! He asked, "How did you know these things?" Rukmini said - "What work do you sing in those words!" Bring the people with me, I will go and find them myself and bring them out. Your royal servants are all sheep—they will not do this.”

Pratapaditya ordered Rukmini along with the people and prescribed appropriate punishment for the guards. One by one the hall became empty. Only the minister and the king remained. The minister thought that His Majesty would tell him something. But Pratapaditya didn't say anything, he sat dumbfounded. The minister said very slowly with the intention of saying something, "Maharaj!" Maharaj did not answer him. The minister got up slowly.

In the evening of the same day, Pratapaditya received the news of Udayaditya's escape from a jailer. Udayaditya was going down the river in a boat and saw him. Gradually, he started getting news from other people. The people who had gone with Rukmini came back after a week and said - I came to see Yuvraj in Raigarh. The king asked, "Where is that woman?" They said, "He did not come back, he stayed there."

Then Pratapaditya called one of his Pathan commanders named Muktiyar Khan and gave him an order secretly. He saluted and left.

## Chapter Twenty-two.

Even before Pratapaditya, Mahishi and Viva learned the news of Udayaditya's escape. Both of them were overwhelmed with fear and thought that when Maharaj comes to know, then they don't know what to do. Every day when Maharaj received news one by one, both of them became more anxious with fear. Weeks went by in this way, until finally Maharaj got reliable news. But he did nothing. He did not show a hint of anger. Mahishi could no longer remain in doubt and once went to Pratapaditya. But for a long time he did not dare to ask anything about Udayaditya. Maharaj also did not raise any issue about it. Finally, unable to stay any longer, Mahishi said - "Maharaj, give me one alms, now measure Udaya!" If you hurt the child any more, I will die of poison!”

Pratapaditya Ishat said angrily, "Before you sat down to cry!" I didn't do anything!”

Lest Pratapaditya should once again bow down, for this reason the buffalo did not dare to raise the matter a second time. He came slowly in fear. One day, two days, three days passed, no change of mind was noticed by Maharaj. Seeing that, Mahishi and Viva were reassured! He thought that Maharaj was satisfied with Udayaditya's transfer.

Now for a few days Mahishi could be at peace.

Earlier, Mahishi had told Viva and made a statement at home that Ramchandra Roy had written a letter requesting Viva to send her to her in-laws. Beaver is no longer happy. Biva had no regrets for a moment until she sent Rammohan away. When he retired, he thought, “What does he think? Did he understand my situation correctly? Either he is angry! If you explain to him, he will not measure me? Oh Jagadishwar, when will I explain? When will we meet again?” Ultia Paltia Viva constantly thought of this. Davanishi had planted a fear in his mind. Hearing the words of the buffalo, Beaver felt immense joy, what a terrible weight was instantly removed from his mind. Laughing and crying, he hid his face in his mother's chest and remained silent for a long time. His mother started crying. When Viva felt that her husband did not misunderstand her, he understood her mind correctly - then the whole world became beautiful in her eyes. Her husband's heart seemed to widen. How much faith, how much confidence was born on her husband's love! She thought that her husband's love was her steadfast refuge in this world. He is fearlessly relying on the huge arms of a mighty great man with his tiny vine-like arms and trusting with infinite faith, nothing will separate him from that reliance. Viva became cheerful. His soul expanded like a clouded autumn sky, became serene. He now plays with his brother Samraditya like a child. Like a little loving girl, she always begs her mother, helps her mother in her housework. What had formerly been a wordless, silent, melancholy shadow of expression, has vanished—now his cheerful heart has blossomed all over him like the clear dawn. The shyness, the shyness, the sadness, the pride, the silence like before are no more. He now happily talks to his mother so much that he would have been ashamed to say it before. Seeing this joy of the daughter, the infinite love of the mother rose. A thought has arisen inside his mind - but he has never expressed that thought even in a glimpse to Biva. Being a mother again, in which life will the beaver's beautiful and peaceful smile become dirty! Because of this, the girl walks around smiling and playing in front of her eyes every day, the mother looks at it with a smile on her face.

There was a fear, a doubt in Mahishi's mind, that's why he couldn't take Viva and send her to her in-laws house until today. Two and one weeks passed, everyone was somewhat reassured about Udayaditya. Only, the buffalo still can't decide what to do about the beaver. A few more days passed. As long as it is delayed. —So much the beaver's impatience is at home. Viva feels that the more the delay, the more she is becoming a criminal towards her husband. When He has called—why delay! Once he apologized, again— For some days Viva said nothing more—at last one day she could not stay any longer; Going to her mother, holding her neck, looking at her face, Viva said, "Mother." His mother could understand everything in that word, pulled Vivah to her chest and said, "What a child!" Viva remained silent for a long time and finally said, "Mother, when will you send me?" Beaver's face and ears turned red as she wrinkled. Mother laughed and asked - "Where will I send Vibhu!" Viva said in a pleading tone - "Don't say mother." Mahishi said, "Sabura a few more days, son. Will send soon.” Tears came to his eyes.

## Section thirty-three.

After many days, Udayaditya came to Raigarh, but he did not enjoy as much as before. There was a thought in my mind, so nothing felt good. He thought that what Dada Mahashay has done, what will happen to him has no address, it is not difficult that his father will give him relief easily. I was born soon! He went to Vasantarai and said, "Grandfather, I am going back to Yeshahar." First Vasantaraya sang and laughed and dismissed this; He sang—

And I will leave you!

I got it with my mind

I will keep it by force.

If you do theft by emptying your heart-full of life

You stay there

Empty heart full core.

Finally, after Udayaditya said repeatedly, Vasantharaya's heart was hurt, he stopped singing and said with a sad face, "Why, Dada, if I am near, what is his illness?" Udayaditya could not say anything else.

Seeing Udayaditya in awe, Vasantaraya tried hard day and night to make him happy. He used to play the sitar, took it around with him - his reign almost stopped for Udayaditya. Vasantaraya was afraid that he would not be able to keep Udayaditya, that Udayaditya would go back to Jasahar. Day and night he kept his eyes on him, saying to him, "Dada, I will not let him go to the land of that stone heart."

As the days went by, Udayaditya's mind relaxed a lot. After many days, after gaining freedom, the narrow rocky four is freed from the prison and lives in the tender heart of Vasantarai, in his infinite love. After many days one sees the trees all around, sees the sky, sees the light of dawn spread across the horizon, hears the song of the birds, the wind howls from the distant horizon, and at night sees all the stars in the sky, drowns in the stream of Jyotna, exists in the soul of sleeping stillness. keep doing You can go wherever you want, do whatever you want, there are no obstacles. All the subjects who had known Udayaditya in his childhood came from far and wide to see Udayaditya. Gangadhar came, Phatik came, Habichacha and Karim Ulla came, Mathur came with his three sons, Paran and Hari two brothers came, Shital Sardar came with five sticks to show the game. People started coming to the prince every day. Yuvraj asked them many things. The subjects were very happy and surprised to see that Udayaditya had not forgotten them yet. Mathur said, "Maharaj, in the month in which you came to Raigad, this son was born to me, you went to see me, after that I have two more children born to me with your blessings." So he brought his three sons to the Prince and said, "Bow down." They prostrated themselves. Paran came and said, "When going from here to Jessore, I was the sailor in the boat that Huzur went to, my lord!" Shital Sardar came and said, "Maharaj, when you were in Raigad, you saw my stick game and gave me boxes, today I want to show my boys' game to Maharaj once." Come on Bapadhan, you go ahead.” Baliya called the boys. Every morning like this, people would come to Udayaditya in groups and talk together.

Being in such affection, in the trees, in the joy, in the joy of singing, naturally the thought came from Udayaditya's mind very relaxed. He closed his eyes and thought that the father may not be angry, he may be satisfied, otherwise what is the matter for so long. Do not do anything!

But he could not forget his mind for a long time in such blind faith. What a fear he felt for his grandfather. It is in vain to tell Dada Mahashay about going back to Jessohar; He decided to hide and escape to Jessohar one day. I remembered that prison again. Where is this joyous freedom, and where is the monotonous life of that narrow little prison! Every moment in prison seemed like a year. He could see clearly in his imagination that lonely, desolate, airless, closed room, his body shuddered. However, he decided that he would have to escape from here one day towards that prison. He couldn't think that he would run away today - he was very relieved to think that he would run away one day.

Today is Thursday, Barbella, today the journey cannot take place, it will happen tomorrow. Today is a bad day. It has been raining continuously since morning. The whole sky is covered with clouds. Udayaditya has decided to leave Raigad this evening. When he met Vasantaraya in the morning, Vasantaraya grabbed Udayaditya and said, “Dada, I had a big nightmare last night. I don't remember the dream well, I just remember it, it's as if I'm parting like birth."

Udayaditya took Vasantarai's hand and said, "No, grandfather! If divorce is possible, why should it be like birth?"

Vasantarai looked to the other side and said thoughtfully, "What else! Tell me how many more days I will live, I am old!”

Last night's nightmare was still reverberating in the cave of Vasantaraya's mind, so he wondered what he was thinking.

Udayaditya remained silent for a while and said - "Dada sir, what will happen if we part again!"

Vasantaraya held Udayaditya's throat and said, "Why brother, why should we part? You left me. At this old age, you threw me away, brother!”

Tears came to Udayaditya's eyes. He was surprised;—what Vasantaraya had sensed in his mind. He breathed and said, "If I stay close, you will be in danger, grandfather!"

Vasantaraya laughed and said - "What's the danger, brother?" At this age, I am afraid of danger! There is no more danger of death! That, death is my neighbor; He always sends to fetch my theory, I do not fear him. A person who overcomes all the dangers of life and survives to old age, did his boat sink when he came to the shore?

Udayaditya stayed with Vasantaraya all day. It started raining all day.

In the afternoon the rain stopped, Udayaditya got up. Vasantaraya said - "Dada, where are you going!"

Udayaditya said - "Let's go for a walk!"

Vasantaraya said - "I have not gone today."

Udayaditya said—"Why, grandfather?"

Vasantaraya: He grabbed Udayaditya and said, "Today you are out of the house, today you stay with me brother!"

Udayaditya said, "I will not go far, grandfather, I will come back now." He said and went out.

As he went to the palace gate, a guard said, "Maharaj, shall I go with you?"

Yuvraj said - "No, it is not necessary."

The guard said - "Maharaj has no weapon!"

Yuvraj said - "What is the need for weapons?"

Udayaditya went outside the palace. There is a long wide field, he went into that field. He started walking alone. Gradually, daylight began to creep in. How many thoughts came to mind. Yuvraj started thinking about this aimless life of his. He thought and saw that nothing is fixed, he has no status anywhere - he has no address for what will happen in the next moment. Age is young, there is still a lot of life left - how will this far-reaching future be spent without having a permanent shelter somewhere? After that he remembered - Biva. Where is Viva now? For so long I was hiding the sun of his happiness - is he happy now? How much he blessed Viva in his heart.

In the field there is a forest of astha, jute, dates, betel-nuts etc. for the shepherds to sit in the sun - Yuvraj went into it. The evening has come. has darkened Yuvraj was supposed to escape today - with that determination he was moving in his mind. When Vasantaraya hears that Udayaditya has run away, what will be his condition—how will he say with a heartbroken face—“Ah. Dada, ran away from me!” He could see that picture clearly.

At such a time a lady said in a shrill voice, — "Here is the cow, here is your Prince — here!"

Two soldiers came and stood near the Prince with torches in their hands. More and more people came and surrounded him. Then the woman came to him and said, "Can you recognize me?" Take a look here! Take a look here.” Yuvraj saw Rukmini in the light of the torch. Seeing Rukmini's behavior, the soldiers scolded her and said, "Go away Magi!" He didn't even pay attention to it and started saying - "Who did all this?" i did Who did all this? i did Who brought all these soldiers here? i brought I did so much for your sake, and you—Yuvaraj turned away from Rukmini in disgust!” The soldiers took Rukmini by force and separated her. Then Muktia came in front of Khan and saluted Yuvraj and stood. Yuvraj was surprised and said - "Muktiyar Khan, what's up?"

Muktiyar Khan humbly said, "Sir, I am coming with an order from our Majesty!"

“What order!” asked the prince.

Muktia Khan took out the order signed by Pratapaditya and gave it to the Prince.

Yuvraj read and said, "What is the need for so many soldiers for this? If you order me a letter, I would go! I have decided to go, I will go. But what is the need to delay? go now Let's go back to Yeshahr now." Muktia Khan folded her hands and said - "I can't return now."

Yuvraj was scared and said - "Why?" Muktia Khan said - "There is one more order, I cannot go without fulfilling it."

Yuvraj said in a frightened voice - "What an order!"

Muktia Khan said - "The Maharaja has ordered the death penalty for the Raja of Raigarh."

Yuvraj was startled and said loudly - "No, you didn't, lie!"

Muktiyar Khan said - "Ajna Yuvraj, it is not a lie." I have a letter signed by His Majesty."

Yuvraj held the commander's hand and said, "Muktiyar Khan, you have misunderstood. The king has ordered that if you do not get Udayaditya, then Vasantaraya—when I am catching you, what else! Take me now, take me now—take me captive, delay no longer!”

Muktiyar Khan said - "Yuvraj, I have not misunderstood. His Majesty has given a clear order.”

Yuvraj said impatiently - "You must have misunderstood. Such is not his intention. Well, come on, let's go. I will explain to you in front of the Maharaja, if he orders a second time, then carry out the order!”

Muktia said with bare hands, "Prince, forgive me, I can't do that!"

Yuvraj became more impatient and said, “Muktiyar, remember, I will get the throne one day. Keep my word, please me!”

Muktia stood unanswered.

Yuvraj's face turned pale, sweat spots appeared on his forehead. He firmly held the commander's hand and said - "If you kill a free, old, innocent, pure soul, there will be no place for you in hell!"

Muktiyar Khan said - "There is no sin in obeying the orders of the master."

Udayaditya shouted loudly, “Lies. The Dharmashastra that says so is a false Dharmashastra. Surely you should know that it is a sin to obey the commandments of Mukti.

Muktia stood unanswered.

Udayaditya looked around and said, “But let me go. I go back to normal. Go there with your army—I call you to battle. Win the battlefield there and follow your orders after that!”

Muktia stood unanswered. The soldiers came closer and surrounded the Prince. Yuvraj did not see any way out and cried out in the darkness "Dada sir, be careful!" The forest trembled—to the edge of the field he joined the tune. The soldiers came and captured Udayaditya. Udayaditya shouted once more - "Dada sir, be careful!" A passer-by was passing through the field — heard the sound and came near and said "Who sings!" Udayaditya hastily said - "Go - run away - warn the king." Soon the soldiers arrested the traveler. Whoever was passing through the field—the soldiers immediately captured him.

A few soldiers kept Udayaditya prisoner, Muktiyar Khan and the rest of the soldiers left the soldier's garb and hid their weapons and went towards Gara in simple garb. Raigarh had more than a hundred gates, through different gates they entered the Garh.

Then in the evening Vasantaraya used to sit and meditate. On the other hand, in the Thakur-house of the Rajbari, the bell of Sandhya Puja is ringing. There is no noise in the big palace, silence all around. As per Vasantarai rules, most of the servants got some time off in the evening.

Vasantaraya suddenly saw that Muktiyar Khan had entered his house. He got up and said, "Sir, don't enter this room." I am coming now

Muktiyar Khan went outside the house and stood near the door. Vasantaraya finished the interview and quickly came out and put his hand on Muktia's neck and asked, "Sir, how are you?"

Saluting Muktia, he said briefly, "Yes, Your Majesty!"

Vasantarai said - "Are you done?"

Muktiyar—"Command yes."

Vasantarai—"Today, however, I will arrange for you to stay here."

Muktia's saying - "No order, no need." Gotta go now after work!”

Vasantarai - "No, that will not happen, sir, I will not leave you today, I will have to stay here today."

Muktiyar—"No, your majesty will have to go soon."

Vasantaraya asked, "Why tell me?" Do you understand the special work? Is Pratap all right?”

Muktiyar — "Maharaj is well."

Vasantarai—“But, what is your business, tell me quickly. Concerned about hearing special urgency. No danger has happened to Pratap."

Muktiyar - "No command, no danger has happened to him. I have come to carry out an order of the Maharaja!”

Vasantarao asked hurriedly, “What order—tell me now!”

Muktia Khan took out an order and gave it to Basant Roy. Basantara took it to Ala and started reading. Meanwhile, one by one, all the soldiers came to the door and surrounded it.

After reading, Basant Roy came slowly to Muktiyar Khan and asked - "Is this written by Pratap?"

Muktia said, "Yes."

Vasantaraya asked again, "Khan sahib, is this written in Pratap's own hand?"

Muktia said - "Yes Maharaj!"

Then Vasantara cried and said, "Khan Saheb, I made Pratap a man with my own hands!"

He remained silent for a while - finally he said again, "When Pratap was so little, I used to hold him day and night - he did not want to leave me for a moment! That Pratap grew up, gave him in marriage, put him on the throne - took his children in his arms - that Pratap wrote this with his own hand today, sir?"

Muktia's dark eyelids got wet, she stood silently in dismay.

Vasantaraya asked - "Where is grandfather?" Where is Uday?”

Muktiyar Khan said, "He has been captured—sent to the Maharaja for trial."

Vasantaraya said - "Uday has been captured? Have you been captured, sir? Shall I not see him once?”

Muktiyar Khan threw up his hands and said - "No sir, no order!"

Vasantarai held Muktia's hand in his eyes and said - "Don't let me see you once, sir!"

Muktia's saying - "I am only a servant of orders."

Basantara took a deep breath and said - "There is no mercy in this world, come sir and obey your order."

Muktiyar then touched the ground and saluted and said with his hands - "Maharaj, forgive me - I am only obeying the Lord's orders, I have no fault."

Vasantarai said - "No sir, what is your fault? There is nothing wrong with you. Shall I forgive you again?" Baliya went to Muktiyar Khan and cuddled with him - said, "Tell Pratap, I died blessing him." And look, sir, when I died, I left Uday's burden on you, he is innocent - see that he doesn't suffer any more from an unjust trial."

Saying this, Vasantaraya closed his eyes and bowed down to the God-god, started chanting the mala in his right hand and said, "Saheb this time!"

Muktiyar Khan called, "Abdul." Abdul Mukt came to the hands of Talaya. Muktia's face turned away. A moment later, Abdul came out of the house with bloody Aussie hands - blood flowed out of the house!

## Section thirty-four.

Muktiyar Khan came back. Leaving most of the troops at Raigarh, he took Udayaditya and immediately marched to Jasahar. For two days on the way, Udayaditya did not touch food—did not speak a word to anyone—just thought in silence. Still as a stone statue—no sleep, no blink, no tears, no sight in his eyes—only thinking. He got into the boat - raised his face from the boat and kept looking at the water, the boat began to move - he began to hear the sound of the waves, the sound of water entered his ears, but he did not hear anything, did not see anything, only began to think. The night came, the stars rose in the sky, the sailors moored the boat, everyone slept in the boat, only the sound of water was heard, the small waves came and hit the boat - Yuvraj looked forward at a glance - looking at the far-reaching white sand hill and began to think only. In the morning the sailors awoke—opened the boat—the morning wind came out—to the eastward, the prince began to think. On the third day, Yuvraj's two eyes began to float and tears began to fall - He kept his head on his hands and looked at the water - He looked at the sky. The boat began to move - the trees on the shore began to pass over the eyes like clouds, tears began to fall from the eyes in a thousand streams. After a long time, Mukti came to Yuvraj with a sad heart and humbly asked - "Yuvaraj, what are you thinking?" Yuvraj got up startled - stared at Muktiyar's face in stunned amazement for a long time. Seeing the expression of compassion on Muktiyar's face, Yuvraj immediately opened his closed heart and said - "I wonder what I did when I was born on earth." What happened to me! O God, why are those who are weak born in this world? What is the benefit of the world by those who cannot stand in the world by themselves - who cling to each other step by step? Whomsoever they seize, they sink, And hinder all the works of the world—Can't even stand, And burden all.—I am a weak coward, God saved me, And those who were the joy of the world, The hope of the world—Destroyed for me? And no, I have departed from this world.”

Udayaditya was brought captive before Pratapaditya. Pratapaditya took him to the inner room and closed the door. Udayaditya's body shuddered as he approached Pratapaditya, the flesh of his whole body shriveled with inevitable hatred — he could no longer look at his father's face!

Pratapaditya said in a serious tone - "What punishment is suitable for you?"

Udayaditya said steadfastly, "Whatever you command."

Pratapaditya said - "You are not worthy of this kingdom of mine."

Udayaditya said — “No, my lord, I am not worthy. I do not want your kingdom—release me from your throne—this begs.”

Pratapaditya also wants that, he said - "How can I know that what you are saying is the truth of your heart?"

Udayaditya said - "I was born with weakness, but till today I have never told a lie for my own interests. If you believe, today I will touch the feet of Ma-Kali and take an oath - I will never rule even a single piece of land in your kingdom - Samraditya is the heir of your kingdom."

Pratapaditya was satisfied and said - "What do you want?"

Udayaditya said—“Maharaja, I want nothing more—just don't keep me in cages like a caged animal! Abandon me, I go now to Kashi. One more alms—give me some money—I will establish a guest house and a temple there in the name of Grandfather.”

Pratapaditya said — "Well, I accept that."

On that day, Udayaditya went to the temple and swore an oath before Pratapaditya - "Mother Kali, you be witness, I swear by touching your feet - as long as I live, I will not accept even a mole of the kingdom of the king of Yeshohar as my sacrifice - I will not sit on the throne of Yeshohar, I will not even touch the scepter of Jashah. If I ever do, the sin of killing this grandfather should be mine?” She said and got up.

When Maharani heard that Udayaditya was leaving Kashi, she came to Udayaditya and said, "Baba Udaya, take me with him."

Udayaditya said, "That's what mother! You have Samraditya, all your family stayed here, if you go from here, there will be no Rajalakshmi in Jasher.”

Mahishi cried and said, "Son, if you have left the family at this age, in what life will I have taken the family?" Abandoning the kingdom, the world, you will become a hermit—who will see him there? I cannot leave him because his father is a stone!” Mahishi loved Udayaditya the most among all his children, and for Udayaditya he wept bitterly.

Udayaditya held his mother's hand and said with tears in his eyes, "Mother, you know that if I stay in the palace, there will be cause for fear at every step - you should be calm, mother, I will be safe at the feet of Visveshwar."

Udayaditya went to Biva and said, “Biva, my sister, I will make her happy before going to Kashi. I will take him with me to his in-laws house, this is my only solution!”

Viva asked Udayaditya, “Grandfather, how is grandfather?”

"Grandfather is fine." Saying that, Udayaditya hurried away from there.

## Chapter thirty-five.

Udayaditya and Biva started to travel. Viva held her mother's neck and cried. Everyone who was in Anthapura, before going to the in-laws' house, gave Bibha various kinds of good advice.

Mahishi once sent for Udayaditya—saying, “Father, Viva is going to be taken away, if they are not careful!”

Udayaditya was startled and said, "Why mother, why should they be careless?"

Mahishi said, "What if they are angry with Viva!"

Udayaditya said — "No, mother, Biva's children, when can they be angry with Biva?"

The buffalo cried and said—"Take it carefully, son, if they disrespect, then Bibha will not survive!"

A fear arose in Udayaditya's mind. It never occurred to him before that his wife could be disrespected by her in-laws. Udayaditya thought that all his karmic results were over - he saw that they were not over yet. He has sheltered Biva, who knows what is in Biva's eyes as a result!

During the journey, Udayaditya and Viva came and bowed down to the mother - in case the journey was interrupted, Mahishi did not cry, but as they left, he fell down on the ground and began to cry. Udayaditya and Vivah bowed to their father and bowed to the other elders of the house. Udayaditya took Samraditya in his arms and kissed him and said to you—“Son, on the throne on which you sit, may the curse of the throne not touch you!” The royal servants loved Udayaditya very much, they came one by one and bowed down to him, all started crying. Finally, both went to the temple and bowed to the deity and set off.

Shayk peril lay behind the arena of torture—the prison of life lay behind. Udayaditya thought, I will not enter this life again in this house. He looked back once. He saw the bloodthirsty, hard-hearted Rajbat standing like a giant with his head raised in the sky. Behind intrigues, arbitrariness, bloodlust, suffering of the weak, the tears of the helpless remained, in front eternal freedom, the unblemished beauty of nature, the natural affection of the heart, compassion stretched out both hands to embrace him. It was just dawn. From the forest on the east side of the river, six high flames of rays have risen; The sun is shining above the tree-tops—the people are waking up, the sailors are singing and raising their sails and opening their boats. Udayaditya's soul rose to sing the song of freedom with the birds at the sight of this beautiful, serene, holy dawn-mukashree of nature. He said to himself, "Birth may I be able to roam freely in this vast greenness of nature, and live together with simple souls."

The boat left. Hearing the songs of the sailors and the lapping of the water, both advanced. Biva's calm heart was filled with happiness, Arun's eyes shone on his face. It was as if he woke up from a nightmare after so many days and was reassured to see the face of the world. The division is going. Who is going to? Who is calling him? Eternal immovable love has called her — Vivah, like a little bird With wings covered with that tender love's layer, Comfortably hides in the faithful heart. Around the world today he can see the ocean of love. Udayaditya called Viva and began to tell her many stories in a voice as soft as the sound of water. Beaver liked what he heard.

The boat entered the kingdom of Ramachandra Raya. Looking around, an unprecedented joy arose in Beaver's mind. What a beautiful sheva! Seeing the cottages and seeing the people, Beaver thought that everyone is happy! Biva was willing, called the subjects and asked them once about their king. Seeing the people, a kind of wonderful love arose in his heart. Everyone he saw liked him. Sometimes the two saw a poor person, Bibha said to herself, "Oh, why is it like this?" I will go to Anthapura and send for him. I will do whatever will relieve his sorrow. Everyone seemed to belong to him. He could not bear the misery and poverty in this state. Biva began to wish, the subjects came to her once and called her mother, offered her their own sorrows to her and she removed that sorrow.

Udayaditya set up a boat in a village near the capital. He decided to send word of their arrival to the palace and they would receive them and take them away. By the time the boat was docked, it was late afternoon. Udayaditya thought that people would be sent tomorrow morning—Biva's heart's desire was to convey the news today.

## Section sixty.

Legions are very busy today. The music is playing all around. There is a festival in the village. This awakened eager joy in Biva's soul, after which, hearing the sound of music all around, her heart seemed to be excited. Lest Udayaditya was exposed to this excessive joy of his, how hard he suppressed his laughter! Udayaditya saw the festival on the banks of the river and went to the village to find out what was going on.

It's been a while. One asked from the shore - "Whose boat is it?" The servants of the palace said from the boat. - "Who? Rammehan that? Hey, SS!” Rammehan quickly entered the boat. Bibha is sitting alone in the boat, seeing Ram Mahon, she is excited and says - " Mahon."

Rammehan—"Mother."

Rammehan Beaver, full of that simple joy, looked at me with a smile for a long time and said with a pale face - "Mom, did you come today?"

Biva quickly said - “Yes, Mahon. Has the king received news in this? Did you come to get me?”

Rammehan said - "No mother, don't be so busy - stay today - I will take you another day."

Seeing Rammohan's expression, Viva became very dirty and said - "Why Mohan - why don't I go today!"

Rammohan said — "It's getting late today — stay today, mother."

Vivah was extremely scared and said, "Tell me the truth, Mohan, what happened?"

Rammohan could not stay. He has no habit of hiding! There he sat down - Kandiya said - "Mother, today you have no place in your kingdom - you have no home in your palace." Today Maharaj is getting married."

Beaver's face turned completely pink. His hands and feet were frozen! Rammohan began to say, “Mother, why did you not come when this ignoble child of yours went to call you, mother? Then why did you turn me back to be a cruel stone, mother? I have no more face to Maharaj! My chest was broken, but I couldn't say a word if I were you!"

Viva couldn't see anything in her eyes, turned her head and fell there. Rammohan quickly brought water and sprinkled it on Beaver's face and eyes. After a while Viva sat up. Beaver's whole world was shattered in one blow. Arriving within the kingdom of Swami, approaching the capital, arriving at the gates of Rajpuri, all the hopes of the thirsty-hearted Biva's happiness met like a mirage.

Viva said anxiously - "Mohan, he who sent me - is there a long delay in my arrival?"

Mohan said, "There has been a delay."

Viva said impatiently - "Don't you apologize?"

Mohan said - "Where did Marjjana do it?"

Biva said — “Mohan, I will go to see him only once.” Balia cried loudly.

Rammohan wiped his eyes and said - "Don't stay today, mother."

Viva said - "No Mohan, I will come to see him once today."

Rammohan said - "Yuvraj first come back from the village."

Biva said - "No Mohan, I will go now."

Biva thought that Udayaditya would not let him go for fear of humiliation when he heard this news.

Ram Mohan said — "But bring one Shivika."

Viva said - "Why Shivika? Am I the queen that Shivika wants. I will go like a lowly subject, like a beggar—what is the work of my servant?”

Rammohan said - "I cannot see it as long as I live."

Viva said in a bitter voice - "Mohan, I fall at your feet, don't stop me - there is a delay!"

Rammohan said with a sad heart - "Well, mother, so be it."

Viva came out of the boat in the guise of a little woman. The servants of the boat came and said - "What is this mother, go somewhere like this."

Rammohan said - "This is the mother's kingdom, you can go wherever you want!"

The servants began to object, Rammohan divided them.

## Chapter thirty-seven.

People around, crowd around. Earlier, Viva would have died of shyness, today nothing seems to catch her eye. Everything you see seems like a lie. All around is like a noisy dream nest—nothing as if nothing. Until a crowd is seen around, a noise is heard from all around, it seems to have no meaning.

As she approached the gate of Rajpuri through the crowd, a doorman held Sasa Biva's hand and restrained Biva - then Sasa Biva fell into the outer world in a moment - she died of shame when she saw her surroundings. His neck was open, he quickly lifted his head. Rammehan was going first, he turned back and stood staring at Dwari—Fernandez was in the distance, he came and caught Dwari and disciplined him. Viva entered the palace. Viva entered the palace like other maidservants—no one greeted her!

Only Raja and Rama were sitting in the house. Biva entered the house and looked at the king's face and fell on the ground at the king's feet. The king stood up and asked, "Who are you?" Beggar—have you come to beg?”

Biva bowed down and looked at the king's face with tearful eyes and said, "No, my lord, I have come to donate all my wealth." I have come to hand you over to the next and bid you farewell.”

Rammehan could not stay, came near and said - "Maharaj, your mahisi - the princess of Jassehar."

Suddenly Ramachandra Ray's soul seemed to startle - but immediately Ramai laughed and looked at the king with a stern voice, "Why don't you remember your grandfather now?"

Ramachandraraya's heart was filled with compassion, yet he laughed cruelly at Ramai's words—he thought—if he showed mercy to Viva now, he would be laughed at.

Biva's head was struck by a thousand thunderbolts—she died of shame—she closed her eyes and said to herself—Mother sings, Vasundhara, you hesitate! Distressed and looked around - looked at Rammehan's face with a helpless look!

Rammehan came running and grabbed Ramai Bhand by his neck and took him out of the house.

The king got angry and said - "Rammamehan, you are rude in front of me!"

Rammehan trembled and said — “Maharaj, I have been rude! Your buffalo has insulted my field - what has happened to him, I will wrap his head and throw him out of the city, but my name is Rammehan!”

The king scolded Rammehan and said — “Who is my buffalo? I don't know him!”

Biva's face turned blue, she clutched her face, her whole body trembled, and finally she fell to the ground in a fit of trembling. Then Rammehan said to the king with his bare hands - "Maharaj, today four men have come to work in your clan. I have raised you since childhood. Today you insulted my Mathakruna, removed your Rajya-Lakshmi - today I also left your job - I will spend my life serving my Mathakruna. I will beg and eat, but I will not step on the shadow of this palace." Balia Rammehan bowed down to the king and said to Vivah — “Come, mother, come! Get out of here quickly! Not to stay here another moment.” Balia grabbed Viva and brought her. There were many maidservants near the door, one of them picked up the unconscious Vivah and returned to the boat.

Viva left Kashi with Udayaditya. There he began to spend his life in charity, meditation, service to God and his brother. Rammehan was with them as long as he was alive. Sitaram also came to Kashi with his family and took shelter of Udayaditya.

The market in Chandradwip in front of which Beaver's boat was docked, still bears the name - "Bau-Thakurani's market."
