# the beginning

It seems to be out of curiosity that the mind once entered from the poetry of the internal to the external imagination, and began to wander hesitantly.

The walled mind went out, then began its journey through the strange paths of the world. If you want to find new pictures and new experiences in his written prose during this time. His first attempt came in Bau-Thakurani's Haat Sagar -- a romantic role playing a human character, also played at a young age. Whatever signs of life were revealed in the characters could not rise above the doll's religion. They are not by their nature driven to inevitable consequences, they are arranged things within a certain framework. Even today, this story can be looked back to. This is like a picture drawn by an uneducated finger; There was no trace of the seasoned hand of a sure mind. But in the playground of art, children also have a value. In the unobstructed path of the intellect, whatever his attention sat on, a certain technicality of the primitive mind came out of him.

A testament to the vividness that occasionally permeates this writing is the fact that I received an unsolicited testimonial from Bankim after this story came out, written in English. He lost the letter due to the carelessness of a friend. Bankim opined that although the book was a juvenile debut, it had an influence of power -- he did not condemn the book. The boy saw something of the inner joy in the man, prompting him to write a sudden letter to the stranger. The distant fate which was unknown brought to him some assurance of hope. This encouragement from him was invaluable to me.

One thing must be said here on this occasion. There was an attempt to erect Pratapaditya as the ideal hero of Bangladesh in the spirit of national enthusiasm. He has not retired yet. From what I gathered from history about him at the time, I found evidence that he was a wrong-doing, tyrannical, cruel man, with the naive arrogance to ignore Delhishwar but not the power. Historians of that time were not influenced by later patriotism. At the time when I wrote this book, his worship was not widespread.
