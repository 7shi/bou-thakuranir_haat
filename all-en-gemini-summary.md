# Bou-Thakurani's Market

## Chapter 1

On a hot, still night, Prince Udayaditya of Jessore confides in his wife, Surma. He laments being born a prince, feeling inadequate and despised by his ambitious father, Pratapaditya, who values political acumen over filial affection. Udayaditya recalls being deemed a failure after a short administrative stint where he prioritized his subjects' welfare over revenue. Surma tries to comfort him, suggesting his father's heart will soften with success, but Udayaditya pessimistically argues that his father's growing power will only amplify his perceived incompetence.

Udayaditya continues his confession to Surma, recounting a painful past affair with a widow named Rukmini, which he considers a moment of madness and a permanent stain on his life. He contrasts this dark period with the hope Surma brought him, calling her his savior who restored his self-worth. He then laments their current situation, where Surma is disrespected at court due to political tensions between their fathers, making him feel like a failure as a husband and contemplate leaving Jessore with her. Surma reaffirms her devotion, stating that her purpose is to support him through these hardships.

Late one night, Udayaditya's sister, Vibha, arrives in a panic at his chamber with terrible news. Despite Vibha's pleas not to go for fear of their father's wrath, Udayaditya arms himself and leaves immediately, supported by his wife, Surma. Left behind, a terrified Vibha worries about the consequences, while a disillusioned Surma expresses her belief that they have little affection left to lose from their father and places her faith in God's protection for the helpless.

## Chapter 2

King Pratapaditya confirms his order to have his paternal uncle, Basanta Ray, assassinated by Pathan mercenaries. When his minister shows hesitation, Pratapaditya angrily justifies the murder as a necessary, righteous act. He frames it as part of his grand mission to save Bengal and the 'Arya Dharma' from the 'Mlechchha' (Mughal) influence, declaring his uncle a traitor and a 'stain' on their lineage for collaborating with them. The narrator reveals the minister's hesitation is a calculated move to secure the king's long-term trust, feigning moral reluctance while being more cunning than the king realizes.

Pratapaditya's minister attempts to dissuade him from the assassination by warning of the repercussions, including the wrath of the Emperor of Delhi and a popular uprising in Bengal. Pratapaditya angrily dismisses these concerns, viewing them as insults and cowardice. He reveals the contradictory nature of his orders to the minister—to give honest counsel but not to actually try and stop him—and forbids any mention of the Emperor until the deed is done.

The minister informs King Pratapaditya that his son, Prince Udayaditya, left alone on horseback at midnight and has not returned. Enraged, Pratapaditya blames his son's wife and maternal family for his perceived weakness, citing a proverb that men take after their maternal uncles. He flies into a paranoid rage, threatening the minister and ordering the negligent guards to be summoned. When the minister mentions that a complaint has been lodged against the king with the Emperor of Delhi, Pratapaditya arrogantly dismisses the threat, claiming he will be the Emperor's judge and punisher.

## Chapter 3

Yubaraj Udayaditya rides his horse, Sugriva, to its death in a desperate night journey to intercept his grand-uncle, Basanta Ray, and save him from assassins. Arriving at an inn in Simultali, he finds Basanta Ray is not there. After a fruitless search, he encounters one of Basanta Ray's retainers, Ratan, who confirms his master should have been at the inn. Realizing the grave danger, the Yubaraj takes Ratan's horse to follow his grand-uncle's tracks, ordering Ratan to follow on foot.

## Chapter 4

By a deserted road at night, the elderly Basanta Ray, waiting in his palanquin, is charmed by his lone Pathan guard's eloquent poetry and refined manners. Believing him to be a nobleman fallen on hard times, the trusting old man offers him a job and, in his delight, plays the sitar and speaks of his beloved grandchildren. The Pathan, actually a hired assassin, plays along, but after hearing the offer of patronage, internally debates whether sparing the old man for personal gain might be more profitable than the religious merit of killing him.

Udayaditya finds his grand-uncle, Basanta Ray, on a deserted road. The Pathan guard, who is actually an assassin hired by King Pratapaditya, confesses the plot. He feigns moral objection and begs for mercy. Despite the betrayal, the forgiving Basanta Ray offers the assassin protection. He then insists on returning to Jessore to confront his nephew Pratapaditya out of love and concern for his soul, much to Udayaditya's dismay.

Basanta Ray's retainers, who were deliberately led astray by the Pathan assassin, finally locate him and Udayaditya. They chaotically recount how the Pathan led them on a wild goose chase for hours before vanishing. The naive Basanta Ray tries to defend the man, whom he still respects as 'Khan Saheb,' while his retainers, with the benefit of hindsight, all claim they were suspicious of the 'Nere' (a slur for a Muslim) from the very beginning.

## Chapter 5

King Pratapaditya anxiously awaits news from the assassins. When one returns, he confirms the job is done but admits he wasn't present for the final act, leaving Pratapaditya suspicious. The King then debates the cover-up with his minister, who insists the public will deduce the truth. Pratapaditya reacts with paranoid fury, accusing the minister of disloyalty. The minister cleverly offers his resignation, a move that secretly pleases the King. When Pratapaditya suggests killing the assassins to ensure silence, the minister again warns it's impossible to hide. The King boasts that he doesn't fear his subjects, even while threatening them with torture, a hypocrisy the minister silently notes.

Pratapaditya, coldly planning to usurp his supposedly deceased uncle's throne, is shocked when Basanta Ray appears alive. The gentle old man confronts his nephew about the assassination attempt, pleading not for his own life but for Pratapaditya's soul. Unmoved and unapologetic, Pratapaditya's suppressed rage erupts when he spots the hired Pathan assassin trying to escape, and he rushes out, ordering the man's capture.

King Pratapaditya, looking for a scapegoat after recent events, berates his minister for supposed negligence and imprisons the guards. He then confronts his queen, who deflects blame for their son Udayaditya's behavior onto his wife, Surma. The queen, aided by a superstitious maidservant, launches a tearful tirade against Surma in front of Udayaditya, accusing her of being a low-born witch who has bewitched him. A distraught Udayaditya watches helplessly as Surma leaves in silent sorrow. The queen later reports to the king that she has successfully "opened Udayaditya's eyes."

## Chapter 6

Surma comforts her sister-in-law, Vibha, who is despondent about her husband, Ramchandra Ray, being disrespected by her father, King Pratapaditya. Vibha insists her husband, a king himself, should not visit unless formally and respectfully invited, fearing he will be insulted. After an emotional outburst, the usually quiet Vibha falls into a sad silence, finding solace in Surma's gentle care.

Basanta Ray arrives and finds his grand-niece Vibha despondent. Through a playful song and witty banter, he, with Surma's help, coaxes the quiet Vibha out of her shell. The conversation turns into a humorous discussion about Basanta Ray's baldness, with Vibha affectionately concluding she prefers him just as he is, successfully lifting her spirits.

The scene begins with playful banter between Vibha and her grand-uncle, Basanta Ray, which Vibha uses to avoid a serious discussion. After she leaves, Surma gravely explains to a concerned Basanta Ray that Vibha is secretly miserable because her husband, Ramchandra Ray, is never invited to court. Upon learning Vibha was crying earlier, a distressed Basanta Ray asks to see her immediately.

Basanta Ray discovers Vibha is unhappy because her husband is not being shown respect by her father, King Pratapaditya. He immediately confronts the king, who surprisingly agrees to send an invitation. Delighted, Basanta Ray returns to cheer Vibha up with music. The scene introduces Udayaditya's young brother, Samaraditya, who is initially wary but quickly charmed by their playful grand-uncle, highlighting the royal family's general suspicion of Basanta Ray.

## Chapter 7

In the court of King Ramchandra Ray of Chandradwip, the royal jester, Ramai Bhand, entertains the king by telling a long, belittling story about a cowardly general named Fernandez. Everyone in the court, including the general himself, is forced to laugh, not out of amusement at the stale jokes, but out of a sense of duty and fear of the jester.

King Ramchandra Ray informs his court jester, Ramai, of his upcoming visit to his father-in-law. Ramai entertains the court with jokes, first by fabricating stories about his own wife being a fearsome giantess, and then by mocking the general's supposed cowardice. The king then orders the general and minister to prepare for the journey.

King Ramchandra Ray of Chandradwip expresses his deep shame over a past humiliation at the court of his father-in-law, Pratapaditya. His jester, Ramai Bhand, delights him by recounting a clever retort he made to the insult. Viewing this war of words as a major victory, the king plans his revenge: to have Ramai infiltrate Pratapaditya's inner quarters and mock the queen mother. For this mission, he appoints the formidable warrior Rammohan Mal, who despises the jester, to lead the escort.

## Chapter 8

The Jessore palace is abuzz with preparations for the arrival of Vibha's husband. The Mahishi (Queen) excitedly dresses a reluctant Vibha in heavy, old-fashioned jewelry. When Vibha secretly gets Surma to fix her hair to her liking, the Mahishi angrily redoes it, accusing Surma of jealousy. Vibha feels flustered, overwhelmed by both the adornments and her irrepressible joy. Her brother Udayaditya is delighted to see her happiness, and her grand-uncle Basanta Ray arrives, playfully teasing her and lamenting his old age, which prevents him from properly appreciating her beauty with youthful passion.

King Ramchandra Ray feels deliberately insulted by the meager reception arranged by his father-in-law, Pratapaditya. Enraged by the disrespect, Ramchandra questions his own status, prompting his jester, Ramai Bhand, to make witty but insulting remarks about Pratapaditya. This infuriates Ramchandra's loyal guard, Rammohan Mal, who offers to silence the jester but is stopped by the king.

Ramchandra, feeling slighted, meets his father-in-law, Pratapaditya, intending to assert his own importance. However, Pratapaditya masterfully humiliates him with a display of cold, dismissive indifference, attending to state business and barely acknowledging Ramchandra's presence before sending him away like a child. The encounter makes Ramchandra realize the true nature and extent of Pratapaditya's power over him.

## Chapter 9

Vibha has an affectionate reunion with Rammohan Mal, a loyal retainer from her husband's kingdom, who delights her with stories and gifts, and moves her mother to tears with a song of longing. Later, Vibha's husband, Ramchandra Ray, arrives in the palace's inner quarters and is subjected to a boisterous and overwhelming ritual of teasing by the women, from which he is only saved by the intervention of a sharp-tongued older woman who outmatches the others in crude insults.

The jester Ramai Bhand, disguised as a woman, is discovered in the palace's inner quarters by the guard Rammohan Mal. When King Pratapaditya learns his son-in-law, Ramchandra Ray, orchestrated this, he flies into a rage and orders Ramchandra's immediate execution. An intervention from his brother-in-law postpones the assassination until morning. Meanwhile, a heartbroken Vibha is being ignored by her humiliated husband. Just as they reconcile, they hear an urgent, ominous knock on their chamber door from the brother-in-law, who has come to warn them.

## Chapter 10

Ramapati warns his nephew-in-law, Ramchandra Ray, of Pratapaditya's execution order and urges him to flee. After Ramapati reveals the news, a distraught Vibha rushes to her brother Udayaditya for help, leaving the terrified Ramchandra alone with her uncle. As darkness falls, Ramchandra's fear spirals into paranoia; he imagines assassins in every shadow and begins to suspect even Ramapati, his only guide, of having ulterior motives.

Distraught over the death sentence passed on her husband, Ramchandra Ray, Vibha rushes to her brother Udayaditya for help. Following his wife Surma's strategic advice, Udayaditya awakens their grand-uncle, Basanta Ray. After a moment of characteristic whimsy upon being woken, Basanta Ray is horrified by the news and, in utter disbelief, agrees to go and confront King Pratapaditya immediately.

Basanta Ray confronts King Pratapaditya, pleading for the life of his son-in-law, Ramchandra Ray, whom he dismisses as an immature boy. An enraged Pratapaditya rejects the plea, condemning Ramchandra's actions and accusing Basanta Ray of hypocrisy and disloyalty for his collaboration with the Mughals. In a desperate final attempt, Basanta Ray offers his own life in exchange for Ramchandra's, breaking down at the thought of his grand-niece Vibha's sorrow. Unmoved, Pratapaditya realizes the escape plan is known and silently leaves to order the canal, where Ramchandra's boat is moored, to be blocked, trapping him in the palace.

## Chapter 11

Trapped in the palace with all exits locked, Ramchandra Ray's party fortifies themselves in a room. Vibha, Udayaditya, and Basanta Ray vow to defend Ramchandra. Surma convinces Udayaditya that waiting is futile, and he leaves to force a way out. Left behind, a distraught Surma prays desperately to the Mother Goddess for her husband's safety, feeling her prayers are unanswered. As the group waits in terror, a paranoid Ramchandra internally blames his retainer Rammohan for the entire catastrophe.

Udayaditya escapes the locked inner quarters to rescue his condemned brother-in-law, Ramchandra Ray. He cleverly overcomes two guards, one of whom willingly helps him due to past loyalty. Udayaditya then rouses Ramchandra's formidable retainer, Rammohan Mal. When Ramchandra appears, he angrily blames and dismisses Rammohan for the predicament. However, Rammohan declares his unshakeable, lifelong loyalty and stands ready to protect his master.

Trapped on the palace roof, the party devises an escape. After Rammohan's initial rash plan to jump is rejected, Udayaditya suggests making a rope from bedsheets. The loyal retainer Rammohan then prepares to carry King Ramchandra on his back down the makeshift rope to a boat waiting seventy cubits below in the canal, offering words of reassurance to a terrified Vibha before beginning the perilous descent.

Rammohan heroically lowers Ramchandra into a boat, after which both Ramchandra and Vibha faint from relief and stress. While Udayaditya tends to his fainted sister, the escape boat is temporarily blocked. However, due to the comical incompetence of Pratapaditya's guards—one of whom stops for tobacco and to collect a debt—the escapees manage to drag their boat past the obstacle. By the time the guards get organized, the boat has reached the Bhairav river, announced by a cannon shot. The sound wakes King Pratapaditya, who calls for his guards only to discover they have all fled.

## Chapter 12

King Pratapaditya awakens to find his guards gone. His minister, trying to manage the king's fury, learns of Ramchandra Ray's escape. To deflect the initial rage, the minister presents the jester Ramai Bhand, whom Pratapaditya dismisses in disgust. Upon officially learning of the escape, the enraged king orders a manhunt for the fled guards and the interrogation of the captured ones.

After Ramchandra's escape, Vibha lies in a stupor while Surma, Udayaditya, and Basanta Ray keep a somber vigil. A confused and guilt-ridden Basanta Ray decides to protect Udayaditya by taking the blame for overpowering the guards. He easily convinces one guard, Sitaram, but has to bribe the second, Bhagavat, who feigns moral objection before quickly accepting the money.

King Pratapaditya interrogates the guards about the previous night's escape. When Basanta Ray intervenes to protect his grand-nephew Udayaditya, Pratapaditya's anger shifts. He accuses Basanta Ray of being a negative influence on the "weak-willed" Udayaditya. Deciding Udayaditya is too foolish to punish directly, Pratapaditya instead banishes Basanta Ray from Jessore, forbidding him from ever seeing Udayaditya again. To further isolate his son, he orders his minister to find a pretext to send Udayaditya's wife, Surma, back to her father's house.

## Chapter 13

Basanta Ray bids a heartbreaking farewell to Udayaditya after being banished, telling him to consider him dead. A distraught Udayaditya refuses to accept the separation. He then shares his fear with Surma that she too will be taken from him. Surma reassures him with fierce determination, declaring that only death can separate them and mentally fortifying herself against this threat.

Udayaditya grieves his banishment from Basanta Ray, sharing cherished memories of him with Surma. They then find Basanta Ray with Vibha, who is plucking his grey hairs while he sings a philosophical song about mortality and accepting the need to move on from the world's stage.

Basanta Ray bids a final, emotional farewell to Udayaditya, Surma, and Vibha. He tries to lighten the mood with jokes and a song, but is overwhelmed by sadness seeing Vibha's tears. Unable to speak or play his sitar, he embraces Udayaditya, declares he will never play the sitar again, and leaves it behind as he departs in his palanquin, heartbroken.

## Chapter 14

A palace maid, Matangini, visits a village woman, Mangala, for a charm against a romantic rival, who is ironically Mangala herself. Mangala plays along and extracts palace gossip: the king's son-in-law has fled, and the maid blames Surma, the prince's wife, for it. Matangini also reveals the king wants to banish Surma. A keenly interested Mangala offers a counter-charm to turn the prince against his wife and asks the maid to help her get into the palace to observe the couple, revealing a hidden, malicious agenda.

## Chapter 15

After Basanta Ray's departure, a grief-stricken Vibha feels homeless in the palace. Udayaditya learns of the poverty of the two guards he dismissed and arranges a stipend for them. Pratapaditya, now paying closer attention to his son, confronts and forbids him from helping the guards. Udayaditya eloquently argues his moral obligation, which only hardens his father's resolve. Surma then takes over, arranging for the stipends to be delivered secretly, but this information is immediately leaked to the scheming Mangala by a 'trusted' maid.

## Chapter 16

When Pratapaditya learns of the secret stipends, he orders Surma to be sent to her paternal home. Surma initially defies him, but Pratapaditya, unable to handle her defiance, tasks the queen with the matter. After failing to persuade Udayaditya, the manipulative queen tells Pratapaditya that Surma has bewitched their son. Enraged, Pratapaditya threatens to imprison Udayaditya, a threat the queen uses to finally coerce Surma into leaving. The segment culminates in a heart-wrenching scene where Surma, faced with a future without Udayaditya, breaks down in absolute despair.

## Chapter 17

The narrative reintroduces Rukmini, Udayaditya's former lover, now living as Mangala. Driven by a vengeful desire to supplant Surma and control Udayaditya, she plots against her. The queen, wanting a charm to turn Udayaditya against his wife, unwittingly seeks help from Mangala, who instead prepares a slow-acting poison designed to kill Surma without evoking pity. On the eve of her scheduled departure from the palace, Surma collapses. In a heart-wrenching scene, she dies in Udayaditya's arms. The queen arrives too late, filled with regret, as the false rumor spreads that Surma took her own life. The segment ends with Udayaditya grieving motionlessly over Surma's body as morning dawns.

## Chapter 18

In the wake of Surma's death, her husband Udayaditya and sister-in-law Vibha are consumed by grief. Udayaditya, feeling he has lost half his life, proposes sending the despondent Vibha to her husband's home in Chandradwip. However, his father, King Pratapaditya, pridefully refuses, demanding that his son-in-law's family must come and 'beg' for her, leaving Vibha trapped in her sorrow at the palace.

## Chapter 19

King Ramchandra Ray is portrayed as extremely paranoid and sensitive about his honor, punishing people for minor perceived insults. During a court session where a poor man is on trial for merely discussing the king, the courtiers, led by the jester Ramai Bhand, engage in a ritualistic session of viciously insulting Ramchandra's father-in-law, Pratapaditya. Delighted by this flattery, Ramchandra magnanimously pardons the terrified man, revealing the sycophantic and petty nature of his court.

In King Ramchandra Ray's court, he, his minister, and jester Ramai Bhand mock Pratapaditya and his son, Udayaditya. The narrator explains Ramchandra's ingratitude towards Udayaditya, who saved his life, attributing it to his petty, narcissistic character, his belief that Udayaditya acted only for his sister's sake, and his weakness to peer pressure. The narrator then dissects Ramchandra's feelings for his wife, Vibha, as a shallow, unfulfilled infatuation, not genuine love. Despite wanting her back, Ramchandra refuses to send for Vibha out of pride, fear of being seen as uxorious, and a petty desire to continue his symbolic revenge against her father.

Rammohan Mal, a loyal retainer, passionately pleads with the paranoid King Ramchandra Ray to bring his wife, Vibha, back from her father's palace. Despite his pride and fear of being seen as weak, the king secretly agrees, but only on the condition that his sycophantic jester and minister are not told, revealing his primary concern is avoiding immediate ridicule rather than long-term consequences.

## Chapter 20

Following Surma's death, Vibha dedicates herself to caring for the grief-stricken Udayaditya, but both are consumed by a shared, silent sorrow. Udayaditya's grief transforms into a paralyzing fear of his father, Pratapaditya. This new, "blind fear" renders him indecisive and unable to act on his principles, as he fails to stop an unjust raid, flees from the sight of a subject being tortured, and cannot bring himself to help two dismissed guards. The narrator explains this isn't a fear of death, but a profound, almost supernatural terror of his father's absolute power over his very existence.

## Chapter 21

This segment introduces Sitaram, one of the dismissed guards, who is stylish but impoverished. He visits the widow Rukmini (also known as Mangala), a moneylender who uses her beauty and wealth to manipulate people. In desperate need of money, Sitaram uses a flirtatious poem to approach her before admitting he just needs cash, spinning a transparent lie to get a loan. Mangala, who harbors her own schemes, plays along and agrees, while the narrator cynically comments that lending money to Sitaram is a guaranteed loss, establishing his character and his connection to the scheming Mangala.

This segment details a comical interaction between the foolish, dismissed guard Sitaram and the manipulative moneylender Mangala (Rukmini). Emboldened by her feigned affection, Sitaram tries to be witty, but his jokes are clumsy and his romantic overtures are based on misremembered mythology. After Mangala coaxes him into calling her various terms of endearment, he abruptly shatters the mood by asking about the interest rate on the money she lent him. When she pretends to be offended, he quickly backpedals, revealing his oafish character.

The segment reveals a secret plot between the dismissed guard Sitaram and Rukmini. On a stormy night, a grieving Udayaditya sits in the dark with a child Surma had loved, hoping to feel his late wife's presence. Rukmini intrudes on this private moment, first feigning to be a spirit and then playing the victim, accusing Udayaditya of ruining her life. Overcome with misplaced guilt, Udayaditya is manipulated until Rukmini tries to sit on his and Surma's bed. He stops her, gives her a ring to make her leave, and is left completely devastated, calling out for Surma.

## Chapter 22

The dismissed guard Bhagavat, a pious but vengeful man, is approached by his foolish former colleague, Sitaram. Together they conspire to forge a petition to the Emperor of Delhi, using a ring with Yubaraj Udayaditya's seal (obtained by Rukmini), which frames the prince for treason against his own father. However, in a double-cross, Bhagavat takes the forged document not to Delhi, but directly to King Pratapaditya, pretending to have foiled the plot. This act of betrayal successfully frames Udayaditya and earns Bhagavat his job back at the palace.

## Chapter 23

Consumed by despair over her husband's silence, Vibha is overwhelmed with joy when his loyal retainer, Rammohan Mal, arrives to escort her home. Preparations are made for her departure, and she shares a poignant farewell with her grieving brother, Udayaditya. However, this encounter makes her realize she cannot abandon him in his misery, for which she feels responsible. In a sudden reversal, she tells Rammohan she will not leave, vowing to stay and care for her brother as long as he is suffering.

A commotion arises when Vibha refuses to return with her husband's retainer, Rammohan Mal. Despite her mother's anger and her brother Udayaditya's pleas, she tearfully resolves to stay and care for the grief-stricken Udayaditya. Her decision leaves Rammohan confused and hurt. Vibha wastes away like a shadow, devoted to her brother. Meanwhile, the traitorous guard Bhagavat presents King Pratapaditya with the forged petition framing Udayaditya for treason. Although Pratapaditya and his minister doubt the prince's guilt, the king orders Udayaditya's imprisonment as a cold-hearted precaution.

## Chapter 24

The loyal retainer Rammohan Mal returns to King Ramchandra Ray's court alone, having failed to bring back Queen Vibha. The king, who had been gleefully planning to taunt his wife about her family, erupts in fury, blaming Pratapaditya for the insult. Rammohan refutes this, declaring he would have taken Vibha by force if necessary, but then tearfully confesses the truth: it was Vibha herself, his revered "lady mother," who refused to leave, leaving the devoted retainer heartbroken by the betrayal of his profound trust in her.

King Ramchandra Ray explodes with rage upon learning his wife, Vibha, refused to return. He banishes the retainer Rammohan, who accepts the blame. Driven by a bruised ego and pressure from his subjects and sycophantic court, the king obsesses over taking revenge. His minister suggests he take a new wife, a proposal seconded by the jester Ramai Bhand, delighting the king and his court. The narrator concludes by condemning the king as a man who is obsessed with honor but has no understanding of what it truly is.

King Ramchandra Ray's court continues to plan his new marriage as a form of revenge. The jester, Ramai Bhand, suggests a series of deep insults, including inviting Pratapaditya to the wedding and sending his daughter Vibha a symbolic offering of contempt. While the king and courtiers find this hilarious, the Dewanji's attempt at a joke fails spectacularly, resulting in awkward silence. The segment ends with the wedding plans being finalized.

## Chapter 25

Udayaditya is imprisoned in a small building adjoining the palace. Despondent, Vibha obtains permission from her father to visit him and dedicates herself to his care, bringing him a small measure of happiness and finding a new sense of purpose for herself. Their bond deepens as she tends to him daily. However, Udayaditya is tormented by guilt, feeling he is dragging his sister down with him. He compares himself to an inauspicious planet and begs her to leave for her own safety, but he realizes she will not abandon him until he is free.

## Chapter 26

Ramchandra Ray, his pride wounded, sends a letter to Pratapaditya officially renouncing Vibha. The messenger, fearing Pratapaditya's wrath, gives the letter to the Queen instead. Already distraught over Udayaditya's imprisonment and Vibha's sorrow, the Queen panics. She attempts to broach the subject with Pratapaditya indirectly by posing a hypothetical about their son-in-law abandoning Vibha. Pratapaditya's cold, angry reaction forces her to backtrack, and her pleas for both Vibha and the imprisoned Udayaditya are dismissed, leaving her utterly defeated.

## Chapter 27

Horrified that their plot has led to Udayaditya's imprisonment, the guard Sitaram confronts his co-conspirator, Rukmini. He flies into a rage, threatening her with ruin and public humiliation, and vowing to go to Raigarh to secure the prince's release. In response, Rukmini experiences a silent, terrifying fury, revealing her dangerously possessive obsession with Udayaditya and resolving to thwart any attempt to free him.

Banished to Raigarh, a heartbroken Basanta Ray sits without his sitar, looking at the sunset. He sings a mournful song about being the only one left, lamenting that the people who gave his life joy are gone, and he wonders how he can continue living with only himself.

The banished Basanta Ray is visited in Raigarh by a companion, Khan Saheb. After a melancholic conversation where Basanta Ray compares his broken spirit to an untunable sitar, his mood abruptly shifts and he gets lost in a lively song. His reverie is broken by the unexpected arrival of Sitaram, one of the dismissed guards from Jessore, prompting Basanta Ray to anxiously ask for news of his family, Udayaditya and Vibha.

Sitaram informs Basanta Ray that Udayaditya has been imprisoned. Deliberately omitting his own role in the conspiracy, Sitaram's news utterly devastates the old man. Basanta Ray, in a state of profound shock, struggles to comprehend the reality of the situation, repeatedly questioning Sitaram before crying out in sorrow for his grand-nephew.

## Chapter 28

Ignoring all warnings, Basanta Ray returns to Jessore and goes straight to the palace's inner quarters. He finds Vibha, and in his desperate hope that the news of Udayaditya's imprisonment is false, he can only bring himself to ask her name. Vibha's silent grief confirms the truth. The sight of Surma's empty, silent room devastates him, reminding him of happier times. Overcome with sorrow, he takes Vibha's hand and sings a mournful line: "I alone am left behind!"

Basanta Ray makes a desperate, emotional plea to King Pratapaditya to release Udayaditya from prison, reminding Pratapaditya of how he raised him like a son. Pratapaditya coldly rejects him. When Basanta Ray begs to at least be allowed to see Udayaditya in his cell, Pratapaditya, angered by this show of affection for his son, refuses this request as well, growing even more obstinate.

After Pratapaditya rejects his plea, a dejected Basanta Ray returns to the inner quarters. Vibha tries to cheer him up with their old game of plucking grey hairs. He first jokes sadly that he's too old, but seeing her distress, he quickly reverts to his playful self. He is then summoned to see the Queen, while Vibha goes to visit her imprisoned brother, Udayaditya.

The Queen confides her despair to Basanta Ray, speaking of her son Udayaditya's imprisonment and her daughter Vibha's declining health. She shows him a letter from Vibha's husband, Ramchandra Ray, which reveals his intention to renounce Vibha. To save Vibha from this disgrace and get her out of the sorrowful palace, Basanta Ray devises a plan: they will keep the letter's true contents secret and instead announce that Ramchandra has written to request Vibha's return, hoping this will persuade the reluctant Vibha to go to her husband's home.

## Chapter 29

Sitaram urgently summons Basanta Ray for a secret, dangerous mission. After whispering the plan to him, Sitaram convinces a hesitant Basanta Ray to leave the palace immediately, without saying goodbye to Vibha, by warning him that any delay will ruin everything and lead to danger.

Udayaditya, imprisoned and unaware of Basanta Ray's return, spirals into paranoid despair, fearing his sister Vibha sees him as a burden and will soon abandon him. His dark thoughts are interrupted by cries of "Fire!" Sitaram, one of the dismissed guards, bursts into his cell, claiming the prison is ablaze, and leads the disoriented prince outside. Overwhelmed by the sudden freedom, a helpless Udayaditya asks his rescuer where to go.

A fire, intentionally set as a diversion, engulfs the guards' quarters, creating chaos that allows Udayaditya to escape. An unnamed woman, furious about the escape, tries to raise the alarm but is ignored and then beaten by one of the arsonists. The assault transforms her anger into a demonic rage, and she attacks him with a burning log.

## Chapter 30

Sitaram leads the escaped Udayaditya to a boat, where he is joyfully reunited with his grand-uncle, Basanta Ray. After an emotional moment, Udayaditya has second thoughts about fleeing and wants to return to prison, but Basanta Ray persuades him to leave by reminding him of Vibha's suffering. As they are about to depart, the vengeful Rukmini appears in a rage, attacks Sitaram, and then throws herself into the canal to drown, leaving the party horrified by the ill omen at the start of their journey.

## Chapter 31

Udayaditya, though freed by Basanta Ray, is wracked with guilt and anxiety in Raigarh, fearing his father's retaliation. Basanta Ray tries desperately to cheer him up with affection and distractions. Udayaditya temporarily finds peace among his loyal subjects and the beauty of nature, but his fear for his grand-uncle's safety returns. He resolves to secretly return to his prison in Jessore to protect Basanta Ray, finding a strange peace in this decision to escape back to his confinement.

On an inauspicious, rainy Thursday, a premonition-filled Basanta Ray pleads with Udayaditya not to leave him, having dreamt of a permanent separation. Udayaditya, concealing his secret plan to return to prison to protect his grand-uncle, is deeply moved but tries to reassure him. Despite Basanta Ray's repeated, emotional pleas to stay, Udayaditya finally leaves in the evening under the pretext of a short walk, refusing an armed escort and questioning the need for a weapon.

Udayaditya, while contemplating his aimless life and intended escape, is captured by soldiers led by Muktiyar Khan. He learns they have orders not only for his arrest but also for the execution of his grand-uncle, Basanta Ray. His desperate pleas, arguments, and challenges fail to sway the commander. In a final, futile act, Udayaditya screams a warning before he and all nearby passersby are captured. Muktiyar Khan and his men then disguise themselves to infiltrate Basanta Ray's fort.

While Basanta Ray performs his evening prayers, Pratapaditya's commander, Muktiyar Khan, arrives with a death warrant signed by the king himself. Devastated by the betrayal of the nephew he raised, Basanta Ray learns his grand-nephew Udayaditya has also been captured. After his plea to see Udayaditya one last time is denied, he resigns to his fate. In a final act of grace, he forgives his executioner, sends a blessing to Pratapaditya, and entrusts the innocent Udayaditya's care to Muktiyar before being killed.

## Chapter 34

As they enter her husband's kingdom, she feels an immediate, deep connection to the land and its people, already planning how to care for them. They moor their boat near the capital, intending to announce their arrival the next morning.

## Chapter 36

Having arrived in her husband's kingdom amidst what appears to be a festival, a joyous Vibha believes the celebrations are for her. Her happiness turns to dread when she meets the loyal retainer Rammohan Mal, whose somber expression and evasive excuses reveal that something is terribly wrong.

The loyal retainer Rammohan Mal reveals to Vibha that her husband, King Ramchandra Ray, is marrying another woman that very day. The devastating news causes Vibha to faint. Upon reviving, she learns that her husband renounced her because she had refused to return with Rammohan earlier. Heartbroken, Vibha begs to see her husband one last time, but Rammohan gently dissuades her.

Despite the devastating news of her husband's betrayal, Vibha insists on seeing him immediately. She rejects a royal palanquin, choosing to go humbly as a commoner, fearing her brother Udayaditya would stop her out of shame. The loyal retainer Rammohan, though pained, relents to her desperate pleas and allows her to leave the boat dressed as an ordinary woman, silencing the objections of other servants.

## Chapter 37

Vibha confronts her husband, King Ramchandra Ray, on his wedding day. Humiliated and publicly rejected by the king, who is goaded by his cruel jester Ramai Bhand, Vibha collapses.
