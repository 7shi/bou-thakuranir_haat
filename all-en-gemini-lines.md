# Bou-Thakurani's Market

## Chapter 1

It is very late at night.
Summer season.
The wind has stopped blowing.
Even the leaves of the trees are not moving.
Jashore's crown prince, Pratapaditya's eldest son, Udayaditya is sitting in the balcony of his bedroom.
His wife Surma is beside him.

Surma said, "Dearest, bear with it, be patient.
One day, happy days will come."

Udayaditya said, "I don't want any happiness anymore, I wish I wasn't born in the palace, I wasn't the crown prince, I was the subject of the smallest and most insignificant subject of the king of Jashore, his eldest son, his throne, his all wealth, honor, glory and the only heir of influence!
What penance can reverse all this?"

Surma became very sad and held the crown prince's right hand with both of her hands and pressed it, and looked at his face and slowly sighed.
She could give her life to fulfill the crown prince's wish, but even if she gave her life, she would not be able to fulfill this wish, this was her sorrow.

The crown prince said, "Surma, just because I was born in a royal family, I couldn't be happy.
In a royal family, everyone is born as an heir, not as a child.
Since my childhood, my father has been testing me every moment to see if I can uphold the glory he has earned, if I can bring honor to the family, if I can bear the heavy burden of the kingdom.
He has been observing my every action, every gesture with the eyes of an examiner, not with the eyes of affection.
My relatives, ministers, courtiers, and subjects have been scrutinizing my every word and deed, calculating my future.
Everyone shook their heads and said, 'No, he cannot save this kingdom from danger.
I am a fool, I don't understand anything.
Everyone started to neglect me, my father started to hate me.
He completely gave up hope on me.
He didn't even bother to ask about me!"

Tears welled up in Surma's eyes.
She said, "Ah!
How could he do that!"
She felt sad and angry, and she said, "Those who thought you were foolish are the foolish ones!"

Udayaditya smiled a little, held Surma's chin and shook her crimson face in anger.
He became serious within a moment and said—

"No Surma, truly I have no talent for ruling a kingdom.
There has been enough proof of that.
When I was sixteen years old, the Maharaja entrusted me with the responsibility of the Hossein Khali pargana in order to teach me the job.
Within six months, there was terrible chaos.
The revenue decreased, the subjects began to complain, and the employees began to complain against me to the king.
The opinion of everyone in the royal court was that since the crown prince had become so popular with the subjects, it was clear that he would never be able to rule the kingdom.
From that time on, the Maharaja did not pay much attention to me.
He used to say—this good-for-nothing will turn out just like his maternal uncle Basanta Ray of Raigarh, he will spend his time playing the sitar and dancing, and he will ruin the kingdom."

Surma said again, "Dearest, bear with it, be patient.
He may be harsh, but he is your father after all.
Right now, his heart is completely filled with the ambition of acquiring and expanding his kingdom.
There is no room for affection there.
The more his ambitions are fulfilled, the more his affection will grow at home."

The crown prince said, "Surma, your intellect is sharp and far-sighted, but this time you have misunderstood.
Firstly, there is no end to hope; secondly, the more the boundaries of his father's kingdom expand, the more he acquires new territories, the more he will fear losing them; the more serious the affairs of the state become, the more he will consider me unfit for them."

Surma did not misunderstand, she just had a false belief; belief also transgresses intellect.
She wholeheartedly hoped that this is how it would be.

“Unable to bear sometimes neglect and sometimes favoritism all around, I used to occasionally run away and go to Raigarh to my granduncle's place.
Father didn't bother to look for me much.
Ah, what a change it was!
There I could see trees and plants, could visit the villagers' huts, didn't have to wear royal clothes day and night.
Besides, you know, wherever granduncle stays, sadness, worries or harshness, seriousness cannot stay within three boundaries of his place.
He keeps the surroundings filled with singing, playing music and merrymaking.
All around there is joy, goodwill, going there I used to forget that I am the crown prince of Jashore.
What a blissful forgetfulness!
Finally when I was 18 years old, one day the spring breeze was blowing in Raigarh, all around were green groves and in that spring I saw Rukmini.”

Surma said, "I have heard that many times!"

Udayaditya, "Listen once more.
Sometimes a word keeps stinging in the heart, if I don't let those words out, how will I survive.
I still feel ashamed and pained to tell you those words, that's why I keep saying, the day I won't feel ashamed or pained anymore, I'll understand that my penance is over, I won't say it again that day."

Surma, "Atonement for what, my love?
If you have committed a sin, the fault of that sin is not yours.
It is mine.
Don't I know you?
Can't the all-knowing see your heart?"

Udayaditya started saying, "Rukmini is three years older than me.
She is a lonely widow.
With the grace of granduncle, she was able to live in Raigarh.
I don't remember how she first attracted me with her tricks and took me away.
At that time, the midday sun was shining brightly in my mind.
It was such a bright light that I couldn't see anything properly.
The whole world around me was covered in a luminous mist.
It felt like all the blood was rushing to my head; nothing seemed surprising or impossible; the path, the wrong path, all directions seemed to have taken on the same form.
This had never happened to me before, and it never happened again.
God knows what his purpose was in inciting the whole world against this small, weak, and senseless heart for a single day, as if the entire universe had united to lead my little heart astray in an instant.
Just a moment—nothing more—a terrible blow from the external world that lasted only a moment, and in that moment, the core of a feeble heart was torn apart, and in the electric shock, it fell embracing the dust.
When it rose again, it was covered in dust and grime, faded, and it never dusted itself off again, the mark of that dirt never went away.
What did I do, O God, that in a single moment, I blackened all the purity of my life with sin?
Turned day into night?
Even the faces of the jasmine and juhi flowers in the garden of my heart seemed to turn black with shame!"

As he spoke, Udayaditya's fair face turned crimson, his elongated eyes opened even wider, and a shiver ran through him from head to toe.
Surma said with joy, pride, and pain, "Forget about that, just kill me."

Udayaditya, "When gradually the blood cooled down, when I was able to see everything in its proper perspective; when the world seemed to be a real field of action and not a distorted, whirling dream-vision of a drunkard with a heated brain and bloodshot eyes, what was the state of my mind then.
What a fall from where to where!
I fell headlong into the abyss of a hundred thousand million leagues of darkness, into the pitch-dark night without blinking an eye.
Grandfather affectionately called me and took me with him; how could I show my face to him after what I had done?
But from that day on, I had to leave Raigarh.
Grandfather could not stay without seeing me.
He would send for me.
I was so scared that I could not go to him by any means.
He himself would come to see me and my sister Bibha.
No complaints, nothing.
He would not even ask why I did not go.
He would see us, enjoy himself and leave."

Udayaditya smiled slightly and looked at Surma's face with immense love, his large eyes filled with tender affection.
Surma understood what was coming next.
She lowered her head and fidgeted a little.
The prince held her face with both hands, lifted her bowed head, moved closer, and gently rested her face on his shoulder.
He encircled her waist with his left hand, kissed her cheek with deep, calm love, and said—

"Then what happened, Surma, tell me?
Where did this intelligent, affectionate, loving, smiling, and peaceful face come from?
Did I ever hope that my deep darkness would be dispelled?
You are my dawn, my light, my hope, what magic did you use to dispel that darkness?"
The prince kissed Surma's face again and again.
Surma did not say anything, her eyes filled with tears of joy; The prince said,—

"After all this time, I have finally found true shelter.
From you, I heard for the first time that I am not an idiot, and I believed it, I understood it.
From you, I learned that intelligence is not like a dark, narrow alley, full of twists and turns and ups and downs, but rather like a royal road, straight and level, wide.
Before, I used to hate you, I used to despise you.
I didn't dare to do anything.
If my heart told me something was right, my self-doubt and conditioning would say, 'It might not be right.'
I would endure whatever treatment I received, I wouldn't try to think for myself.
After all this time, I feel like I am something, I am somebody.
For so long, I was invisible, but you brought me out, Surma, you discovered me.
Now, whatever my heart tells me is good, I want to do it immediately.
I have such faith in you that when you believe in me, I can fearlessly believe in myself too.
Where did you find the strength in that delicate body of yours to make me strong as well?"

But in a manner of boundless reliance, Surma encircled her husband's chest and held him.
With what a completely self-surrendering gaze she kept looking at his face!
Her eyes said, "I have nothing else, only you are there, so I have everything!"

Since childhood, Udayaditya has been enduring the neglect of his relatives, sometimes on a quiet, deep night, he really enjoys discussing that age-old life story, narrated a hundred times, with Surma, step by step, in detail.

Udayaditya said, "How long can we go on like this, Surma?
On one hand, the courtiers in the royal court look at me with a kind of pity, and on the other hand, inside the palace, mother insults you; even the servants don't respect you.
I can't say anything harsh to anyone, I keep quiet, I endure.
You have a fiery nature, but you also silently endure.
When I couldn't make you happy, when all you got from me was insult and pain, then it would have been better if we had never gotten married."

Surma, - "What are you saying, my lord?
It is at this time that Surma is needed.
What could I have done for you during happy times?
In times of joy, Surma is an object of luxury, a plaything.
After overcoming all sorrows, this happiness has awakened in my mind that I am of use to you, that I am enjoying the incomparable joy of bearing sorrow for you.
My only regret is that I could not bear all your suffering?"

The prince remained silent for a while and then said, "I don't think much about myself.
I have endured everything.
But why should you suffer humiliation because of me?
You have truly consoled me in my sorrow and given me rest in my exhaustion like a wife, but I, as a husband, could not protect you from humiliation and shame.
Your father, the king of Sripur, does not accept my father as his superior and does not acknowledge himself as a vassal of Jashore.
Therefore, my father shows disregard towards you to maintain his own supremacy.
He turns a deaf ear when someone insults you.
He thinks that it is enough for you to be his daughter-in-law.
Sometimes I feel that I can't take it anymore and want to leave everything behind and go away with you.
I would have done it long ago, but you have been the only one holding me back."

The night deepened.
Many evening stars set, and many deep-night stars rose.
The sound of footsteps of the guards at the gate tower can be heard from afar.
The whole world is asleep.
All the lamps in the city have been extinguished; houses are closed; except for a stray jackal or two, there is not a single living soul.
The door of Udayaditya's bedroom was closed.
Suddenly, someone from outside started knocking on the door.
The startled prince opened the door.
"Why?
Bibha?
What happened?
Why have you come here so late at night?"

Readers are already aware that Bibha is Udayaditya's sister.
Bibha said, "I think everything is ruined now!"
Surma and Udayaditya asked together, "Why, what happened?"
Bibha whispered something in a trembling voice.
She couldn't hold back any longer as she started crying and said, "What will happen to Dada?"

Udayaditya said, "Then I shall leave!"
Bibha exclaimed, "No, no, don't go."

Udayaditya: "Why Bibha?"

Bibha: "What if father finds out?
What if he gets angry with you?"

Surma said, "Fie, Bibha; is this the time to think about that?"

Udayaditya tied his sword around his waist after wearing his clothes and prepared to leave.
Bibha held his hand and said, "Brother, please don't go, send someone else, I am very scared."

Udayaditya said - "Bibha won't create any obstacle now; there is no time."
Saying this, he immediately went out.

Bibha held Surma's hand and said, "What will happen if father finds out?"

Surma said, "What else will happen?
I feel there is no love left.
Even if the little that is left is gone, it won't be a big loss."

Bibha said, "No brother, I am very scared.
What if father does some harm?
What if he punishes me?"

Surma sighed and said, "I believe that for those who have no support in the world, Narayana is their greatest support.
Oh Lord, may your name not be tarnished!
Please do not break my faith!"

## Chapter 2

The minister said, "Your Majesty, will the task be successful?"

Pratapaditya asked, "Which task?"

The minister said, "What you had ordered yesterday."

Pratapaditya said in annoyance, "What did I order yesterday?"

The minister said, "About your paternal uncle."

Pratapaditya, getting even more annoyed, said, "What about my paternal uncle?"

The minister said, "The king had ordered that when Basanta Ray takes shelter at the Simultoli grove on his way to Jashore, then—"

Pratapaditya knitted his brows and said, "Then what?
Finish the sentence!"

Minister - "Then two Pathans went and-"

Pratap - "Yes."

Minister - "Kill him."

Pratapaditya said angrily, "Minister, have you suddenly become a child?
Why do you ask ten questions to hear one thing?
Are you hesitating to speak your mind?
I think it's time for you to retire from your duties and focus on the afterlife.
Why didn't you ask for retirement earlier?"

Minister - "Your Majesty, you have not been able to understand my feelings properly."

Pratap - "I understand perfectly.
But I want to ask you one thing, the task that I can do, you can't even utter it?
You should have considered that when I am going to do this task, there must be a serious reason behind it; I must have thought about religion and irreligion."

Minister - "As you command, Your Majesty, I-"

Pratap - "Be quiet, listen to everything I have to say first.
When I did this task - when I tried to kill my own paternal uncle, I definitely thought about it a lot more than you did.
There is no injustice in this act.
My vow is this - these barbarians who have come to our country and started committing atrocities, because of whose tyranny the eternal Aryan religion is on the verge of disappearing from our country, the Kshatriyas are giving their daughters to the Mughals, the Hindus are becoming corrupt, I will drive these barbarians away, I will free our Aryan religion from the clutches of Rahu.
A lot of strength is required to fulfill this vow.
I want all the kings of Bengal to unite under me.
Unless those who are friends of the foreigners are destroyed, this cannot be achieved.
My paternal uncle Basanta Ray is my revered elder, but to tell the truth, he is the disgrace of our lineage.
He has accepted himself as a slave of the barbarians, Pratapaditya Ray has no relation with such a person.
If injured, one's own arm can be cut off; I wish to save the Ray dynasty and Bengal by cutting off that Basanta Ray, the wound of the lineage, the wound of Bengal."

The minister said, "I had no other opinion on this matter with the Maharaja."

Pratapaditya said, "Yes, there was.
Speak the truth.
It still exists.
Listen, minister, as long as your opinion does not match mine, express it.
If you do not have that courage, then this position is not for you.
If you have doubts, then speak up.
Give me a chance to convince you.
Do you think that killing one's paternal uncle is always a sin?
Do not say 'no', this is exactly what is coming to your mind.
There is an answer to this.
At the request of his father, Bhrigu killed his own mother, can't I kill my paternal uncle at the request of dharma?"

In this matter—that is, in the matter of religion and irreligion—the minister truly had no opinion.
As far as the minister had understood, the king had not been able to understand that far.
The minister knew very well that if he showed hesitation in the present matter, then the king would indeed be angry at first, but in the end, he would be secretly pleased because of it.
If he did not do so, then at some point in time, suspicion and apprehension about the minister could arise in the king's mind.

The minister said, "I was saying that, the emperor of Delhi will definitely be angry after hearing this news."

Pratapaditya flared up, "Yes, yes, you will be angry!
Everyone has the right to be angry.
The emperor of Delhi is not my God.
There are enough people who will tremble and shiver if he gets angry - there's Mansingh, there's Birbal, there's our Basanta Ray, and recently I see you too; but don't think everyone is like you."

The minister said with a laugh, "Yes, Your Majesty, I don't fear empty threats much either, but if there is a shield and a sword along with them, then one has to think twice!
The wrath of the Emperor of Delhi means fifty thousand soldiers."

Pratapaditya, unable to give a satisfactory answer to this, said, "Look, minister, don't try to deter me from doing something by showing me the fear of the Delhi emperor.
That insults me deeply."

The minister said, "What will the subjects say if they come to know?"

Pratap - "If you could know?"

Minister—"This work will not remain a secret for long."

"If this news gets out, the whole of Bengal will turn against you.
The purpose for which you want to do this will be completely destroyed.
You will be ostracized and subjected to various kinds of persecution."

Pratap - "Look, minister, I am telling you again, whatever I do, I do after careful consideration.
Therefore, when I start a task, don't try to discourage me by showing me a bunch of imaginary fears.
I am not a child.
I have not kept you as my minister to obstruct me at every step."

The minister fell silent.
The king had given him two orders.
One, to express his opinion as long as there was a difference of opinion, and second, not to try to dissuade the king from doing something by expressing his opposing opinion.
The minister had not been able to reconcile these two orders well until today.

After a while, the minister said again, "Your Majesty, the Emperor of Delhi" --!
Pratap Aditya flared up and said, -- "Again the Emperor of Delhi?
Minister, if you were to take the name of the Lord of the Universe as many times as you take the name of the Emperor of Delhi during the day, then you would be able to settle the matter of the afterlife.
Do not utter the name of the Emperor of Delhi until I have finished this task.
When I receive the news of the completion of this task this afternoon, come and whisper the name of the Emperor of Delhi in my ear to your heart's content!
Until then, exercise a little self-control!"

The minister fell silent again.
Stopping the talk about the emperor of Delhi, he said, "Your Majesty, the crown prince Udayaditya—"

The king said - "The emperor of Delhi is gone, the subjects are gone; now will you threaten me by talking about that effeminate boy?"

The minister said, "Your Majesty, you are completely misunderstanding.
I have absolutely no intention of obstructing your work."

Pratapaditya said in a cold voice, "So what were you saying?"

The minister said, "Last night, the crown prince suddenly mounted his horse and left alone.
He hasn't returned yet."

Pratapaditya said in annoyance, "Where did you go?"

The minister said, "Eastward."

Pratapaditya gritted his teeth and said, "When did you go?"

Minister - "Yesterday, around midnight."

Pratapaditya said, "Is the daughter of the landlord of Shreepur here?"

Minister - "Yes, your highness!"

Pratapaditya - "It would have been better if she had stayed in her father's house."

The minister did not give any reply.

Pratapaditya said, "Udayaditya was never like a prince.
Since his childhood, he has been mingling with the subjects.
Who knew that my son would turn out like this?
Does a lion cub need to be taught how to become a lion?
But then, naraanam maatrulakramah.
I think he has inherited the nature of his maternal grandfather.
On top of that, I recently married him off to the house of Shreepur; since then, the boy has completely gone downhill.
May God be kind, and may my younger son be worthy, so that if I am unable to finish what I have started, I may not have any regrets at the time of my death!
Has he still not returned?"

Minister - "No, your highness!"

Pratapaditya said, stamping his foot on the ground, "Why didn't a guard go with him?"

Minister - "One person was ready to go, but he forbade him."

Pratap - "Why didn't you go away invisibly, staying far away?"

Minister - "They did not suspect any foul play."

Pratap - "I did not doubt.
Minister, are you trying to make me understand that they did a great job?
Minister, don't try to make me understand something useless.
The guards have been very negligent in their duty.
Call the ones who were at the gate at that time.
If any of my wishes are thwarted because of this incident, I will destroy everything.
Minister, then you too have something to fear.
You have come to me to prove that no one is responsible for this!
But the responsibility is yours!"

Pratapaditya sent for the guards.
After being serious for a while, he asked, "Yes.
What were you saying about the emperor of Delhi?"

Minister - "I heard that a complaint has been made against you to the Emperor of Delhi."

Pratap - "Who?
Your crown prince Udayaditya?"

Minister - "Your Majesty, please do not say such things.
Who did it?
We have not found out yet."

Pratap - "Whoever did it, don't worry about it too much.
I am the judge of the King of Delhi, I am the one who is taking the initiative to punish him.
Haven't those Pathans returned yet?
Has Udayaditya not arrived yet?
Call the guard quickly."

## Chapter 3

The prince galloped his horse at lightning speed along the deserted path.
It was a dark night, but since the path was long, straight, and wide, there was no fear of danger.
In the still night, the sound of the horse's hooves echoed all around, a few dogs barked and howled, and a couple of jackals, startled, left the path and hid in the bamboo groves.
In the sky, stars twinkled, and fireflies glowed on the trees along the path; in the air, crickets chirped incessantly; and among the humans, a skeletal old beggar woman slept under a tree!
After traveling five leagues, the prince left the path and entered a field.
He had to slow down his horse's pace!
It had rained during the day, the ground was wet, and the horse's feet kept sinking.
As it went, the horse stumbled and fell three times.
The exhausted horse's nostrils were flared, foam was coming out of its mouth, and foam had formed from the friction of its hind legs; a sound came from within its ribcage, and its whole body was drenched in sweat.
On the other hand, it was a terrible summer, there was not a breath of air, and there was still a long way to go.
After crossing many water bodies and cultivated fields, the prince finally came to an unpaved road.
He urged his horse to a faster pace again.
Once he patted its shoulder and called out encouragingly, "Sugriva!"
The horse perked up its ears, looked at its master with big, slanted eyes, arched its neck and neighed, and lowered its head forcefully, slackening the reins and galloping with its neck bent and breathing heavily.
The trees on both sides could not be seen clearly, and when he looked up at the sky, it seemed as if groups of stars were flying past like sparks, and the still air in the sky rippled and rustled in his ears.
When it was the third watch of the night, and the jackals were howling near the village, the prince arrived at the gate of the Shimultali inn and stopped.
His horse immediately collapsed to the ground, lifeless.
He got down, patted its back, lifted its head, and called out "Sugriva" many times, but it did not move.
Sighing deeply, the prince went to the door and knocked.
After repeated knocks, the innkeeper, without opening the door, said through the window, "Who are you at this hour of the night?"
He saw an armed young man standing at the door.

The crown prince said, "I have a question, open the door."

He said, "Is it necessary to open the door, whatever you have to ask, ask!"

The crown prince asked, "Is the king of Raigarh, Basanta Ray, here?"

She said, "Yes, he was supposed to come after dusk, but he hasn't come yet.
I don't think he's coming today."

The prince took two coins and said loudly, "Here, take these."

He hurriedly ran and opened the door and took the two coins.
Then the crown prince said to him, "Son, I will search your shop once to see who all are there?"

The guard of the market said doubtfully, "No sir, that won't do."

Udayaditya said, "Don't stop me.
I am an employee of the royal palace.
I have come in search of two criminals."

Saying this, he entered.
The guard at the door did not stop him anymore.
He searched the whole place.
He could not find Basanta Ray, his followers, or any Pathan.
Only two old women who had just woken up shouted, "Why are you staring at us like that at this hour of the night?"

After coming out of the market, the prince stood on the road and started thinking.
At first, he thought that it was good, maybe today, by chance, he could not come.
Then he thought, what if he was in one of the previous markets and the soldiers went there in search of him?
Thinking like this, he started walking along that path.
After walking some distance, he saw a horseman coming from the opposite direction.
When he came near, he said, "Who is it?
Is it Ratan?"
He immediately got down from the horse, bowed to him and said, "Yes, Your Highness.
You are here so late at night?"

The crown prince said, "I will tell you the reason later.
Now tell me where is granduncle."

"Yes, he is supposed to stay in his place."

"What is it?
I didn't see him there."

He said in surprise, "The Maharaj has left for Jashore with thirty followers.
I fell behind due to some work.
I was supposed to meet him at this inn tonight."

"Since there was mud on the road, I followed his footprints to search for him.
I took your horse.
You come on foot!"

## Chapter 4

On the side of the deserted road, under the Ashoka tree, the old Basanta Ray is sitting in a palanquin resting on the ground, with no carriers.
There is no one else nearby, except a Pathan standing outside the palanquin.
A cacophony of voices faded away in the distance.
The night became still.
Basanta Ray asked—

"Khan Saheb, why didn't you go?"

The Pathan said, "Your highness, how can I leave?
You sent all your followers to protect our lives and wealth.
Don't let me be known as such a great ingrate that I would leave you unprotected on the side of the road at night.
Our poets say that he who does me wrong becomes indebted to me, and in the afterlife he will have to repay that debt; he who does me a favor, I become indebted to him, but I will never be able to repay that debt."

Basanta Ray thought to himself, "Bravo, this boat is really good."
After arguing for a while, he stuck his head worth twenty thousand rupees out of the palanquin and said, "Khan Saheb, you are a very good man."

Khan Saheb immediately saluted.
Khan Saheb had no disagreement with Basanta Ray on this matter.
Basanta Ray examined his face in the light of the torch and said, "You seem to be a man of the big house."

The Pathan saluted again and said, "What a surprise, Your Majesty, you have guessed it right."

Basanta Ray said, "What are you going to do now?"

The Pathan sighed and said, "Your Honor, I have fallen on hard times.
Now I have to farm to make a living.
The poet says—'O fate, your cruelty is not evident in the fact that you have made straw out of straw, but in the fact that you have made the peepal tree a peepal tree and finally made it lie flat with the straw in the hands of the storm.
I can guess that your heart is made of stone!"

Basanta Ray, becoming very excited, exclaimed, "Bravo, bravo, what a thing the poet has said.
Sahib, the two verses that you recited today, you must write them down for me."

The Pathan thought that his luck was good.
The old man was very clever; he could be of great help to the poor.
Basanta Ray thought, Alas, the man who was once so rich is in such a bad state today!
How cruel is the fickle Goddess of Wealth!
He felt a little sad and said to the Pathan—

"With such a beautiful body like yours, you could easily be recruited in the army."

Pathan immediately said, "Your honor, of course we can!
That is our job after all.
All my ancestors died with swords in their hands, and that is my only desire.
The poet says,—

Basanta Ray said with a laugh, "Poet, say whatever you want, son, if you accept my job, then my desire to die with a sword in my hand may be fulfilled, but it is not in your destiny to unsheath that sword.
I have grown old, the subjects are happy and comfortable, may God bless, so that there is no need to fight again.
I have aged; I have given up the sword.
Now instead of the sword, someone else has accepted my hand."
Saying this, he woke up his companion sitar lying beside him by strumming it once or twice.

The Pathan nodded his head and said with his eyes closed, "Ah, what you are saying is right.
There is a saying that one can conquer an enemy with a sword, but one can befriend an enemy with music."

Basanta Ray exclaimed, "What do you say, Khan Saheb?
That enemies can be made allies through music, how wonderful!"
He paused and thought for a moment, and the more he thought, the more amazed he became.
After a moment, he explained Boyeti’s words and said, "Even with a sword, which is a terrifying weapon, one's enemies cannot be defeated — how can I say defeated? —
Killing the patient to cure his illness, what sort of healing is it?
But music is such a sweet thing that it can eliminate enmity without enemies being destroyed.
Is this just ordinary poetry?
Wow, what a praise!"
The old man got so excited that he put one foot openly out of the palanquin, asked the Pathan to come closer, and said, "Enemies can be defeated with a sword, but with music, enemies can be made allies, what do you say, Khan Saheb?"

Pathan - "Yes, Your Honor."

Basanta Ray—"You go to Raigarh once.
After returning from Jashore, I will help you as much as I can!"

The Pathan said cheerfully, "If you wish, what can't you do!"
The Pathan thought, I have somehow managed to gather quite a lot.
He asked, "Do you know how to play the sitar?"

Basanta Ray said, "Yes."
And immediately picked up the sitar.
He started playing Behag Alap, adjusting the strings with his fingers.
In between, the Pathan nodded his head and exclaimed, "Bravo! Excellent."
Gradually, under the influence of excitement, it became impossible for Basanta Ray to sit inside the palanquin.
He stood up and started playing.
He forgot all about dignity, seriousness, and self-respect, and while playing, he finally started singing, "Kaise kaatoongi rain, so piya bina."

When the song ended, Pathan said, "Wow, what a wonderful voice."

Basanta Ray said, "Then I think, in the quiet of the night, in the open field, everyone's voice sounds sweet.
Because, I have practiced a lot, but people don't really praise my voice.
But then, just as the Creator has given a cure for every disease, similarly, for every voice, there is a listener.
I also have two modern listeners who like my voice.
Otherwise, I would have closed shop long ago; those two naive customers, they don't know good music, I get appreciation from them.
I haven't seen them in a long time, and I have stopped singing; that's why I am rushing; I will sing to my heart's content, unburden my soul, and then return home."
The old man's dim eyes lit up with affection and joy.

The Pathan thought to himself, "One of your wishes has been fulfilled, you have heard the song, should I now take the burden of your life?
God forbid, God forbid, to do such a thing!
It is true that there is virtue in killing a kafir, but I have earned so much of that virtue that I have no more worries about the afterlife, but seeing the way everything in this world is in disarray, I see no harm in sparing the kafir's life if I can make him my slave."

Basanta Ray could not remain silent for long; his imagination was aroused; he came closer to the Pathan and said in a very low voice, "Do you know, Sahib, who I was talking about?
They are my grandson and granddaughter."
As he spoke, he became impatient, thinking, "When will my followers return?"
He picked up the sitar again and started to sing.

A man on horseback approached and said, "Ah, I am saved.
Uncle, to whom are you singing songs at this hour of the night by the roadside?"

Overwhelmed with joy and surprise, Basanta Ray immediately placed his sitar on the palanquin, held Udayaditya's hand and helped him get down, and embraced him tightly; he asked, "What is the news, Dada?
Is Didi well?"

Udayaditya said, "Everything is auspicious."

Then the old man picked up the sitar with a smile and started to sing, keeping the beat with his foot and nodding his head.

"Why have you come at such an odd hour,Prakash?"

All that everyone says is a dream, believe it.

Were you in Chandrabati's bower, did you get affection there?

In the meantime, what hope of love for Miti!

Still the night remains, dawn has not yet broken,

Even now, Radha's tears have not stopped flowing.

Did Chandrabati's flower decoration dry up today?

O Chakora bird, did you meet, that moon-like face's sweet smile?"

Udayaditya looked at the Pathan and asked Basanta Ray in a whisper, "Uncle, where did you find this Kabuli?"

Basanta Ray quickly said, "Khan Saheb, very good person.
Wise man.
We had a very enjoyable evening today."

Seeing Udayaditya, Khan Saheb became very restless in his mind, he was wondering what to do.

Udayaditya asked his grandfather, "Why are you here instead of going to the fair?"

Pathan suddenly said, "Your Honor, I have a request.
We are the subjects of Raja Pratapaditya.
The Maharaja ordered me and my brother that when you come to Jashore, you should kill you on the way!"

Basanta Ray exclaimed in surprise, "Ram, Ram, Ram!"

Udayaditya said, "Tell me!"

Pathan - "We never do such things, so he threatened us in various ways when we objected.
Therefore, we were forced to set out on this mission.
We met you on the way.
My brother started crying and wailing, saying that our village was being looted by bandits, and he took your followers with him.
I was entrusted with this task.
But, Your Majesty, even though it was the king's order, I was in no way inclined to do such a thing.
Because, our poets say, you can destroy the whole world on the orders of the king or the lord, but be careful, don't even destroy a corner of heaven.
Now, poor me, I have taken refuge in Your Majesty.
If I return to my country, I will be ruined.
If you don't protect me, I have no other way!"
Saying this, he stood with folded hands.

Basanta Ray stood there, astonished.
After a while, he said to the Pathan, "I will give you a letter, you go to Raigarh.
When I return there, I will do something good for you."

Udayaditya said, "Granduncle, will you not go to Jashore again?"

Basanta Ray said, "Yes, brother!"

Udayaditya said in surprise, "What are you saying!"

Basanta Ray - "Pratap is no one else but mine, even if he commits a thousand crimes, he is still the object of my affection!
I am not afraid of any harm coming to me.
I am standing on the shore of the ocean of life, brother; one wave and I am finished.
But if I commit this sinful act, what harm will come to Pratap in this world and the next, can I rest assured?
I will embrace him and explain everything to him once."

As Basanta Ray spoke, tears came to his eyes.
Udayaditya covered his eyes with both hands.

At that moment, Basanta Ray's followers returned, making a commotion.

"Where is the king?
Where is the king?"

"I am right here, my son, where else would I go?"

Everyone said in unison, "Where is that rascal?"

Basanta Ray, feeling embarrassed, intervened and said, "Yes, yes, my boy, don't say anything to your Khan Saheb."

First—"Today, Maharaj, I suffered a lot, today that—"

Second one—“You stop; I will tell you everything in order.
That Pathan guy took us straight and finally inside a mango orchard on the left—”

Third one—"Oh, that's Babla forest."

Fourth—"That's not left-handed, that's right-handed!"

Second one—"Far throw, that's a left-hander."

Fourth—"Is it left-handed just because you said so?"

Second one—"If
it's not left-handed, then that pond—"

Udayaditya - "Yes, son, it seems to be left-handed, then go on."

Second one—“Yes sir!
That left-handed man took me through a mango orchard to a field.
We crossed many cultivated fields, wetlands, and bamboo thickets, but I didn't even get a whiff of the village name.
After walking around like this for three hours, when we were close to the village, that rascal disappeared somewhere, and I couldn't find him.”

First—“I didn't like that guy the moment I saw him.”

Second—“I also thought that something like this would happen.”

Third one—“When I saw him fidgeting, I suspected him!”

Finally, everyone expressed that they had understood everything from before.

## Chapter 5

Pratapaditya said, "Look, minister, those two Pathans haven't arrived yet!"

The minister said slowly, "That's not my fault, Your Majesty!"

Pratapaditya said in annoyance, "Let's not talk about the blame.
There must be a reason for the delay, right?
I am asking you to guess it."

Minister: "Shimultali is quite far from here.
It will take time to go there, get the work done, and return."

Pratapaditya was displeased with the minister's words.
He wanted the minister to guess what he was thinking.
But the minister didn't go in that direction.
Pratapaditya said, "Udayaditya went out last night?"

Minister: "Yes, your highness, I have already informed him."

Pratapaditya: "I told you before!
Why did you tell me at such an opportune moment?
Do you think your job is done just by telling me whenever you feel like it?
Udayaditya wasn't like this before.
I think the daughter of the landlord of Shreepur must have given him some bad advice.
What do you think?"

Minister: "How do I say it, Your Majesty?"

Pratapaditya exclaimed, "Do you want me to listen to the words of the Vedas from you?
Don't you just say whatever comes to your mind!"

Minister: "You hear everything about Bou-Thakurani from your wife, so you can guess how I would know?"

A Pathan entered the house.

Pratapaditya said, "What happened?
Have you finished your work?"

Pathan.
"Yes, Your Majesty, it has been cleared by now."

Pratapaditya: "What kind of talk is that?
Don't you know?"

Pathan: "Yes sir, I know.
The work is done, there is no mistake in that, but I was not present at that time."

Pratapaditya: "Then how did the work get done?"

Pathan.
"According to your advice, I have been keeping his people separate, and Husain Khan has finished the job."

Pratapaditya!
"Why don't you sleep?"

Pathan.
"Your Majesty, I pledge my head."

Pratapaditya: "Alright, stay there.
You will be rewarded when your brother returns."

The Pathan stood at a distance near the door, in the custody of the guards.

Pratapaditya remained silent for a long time and then slowly said to the minister, "We must try to ensure that the subjects do not know about this in any way."

The minister said - "Your Majesty, please do not be displeased if I say that this will be revealed anyway."

Pratapaditya: "How did you come to know?"

Minister: Previously, you have openly expressed your hatred towards your paternal uncle.
You did not invite Basanta Ray to your daughter's wedding, he came uninvited and attended the wedding.
Today, you suddenly invited him without any reason and someone killed him on the way.
In such a situation, the subjects will consider you as the main culprit of this incident."

Pratapaditya said angrily, "Minister, I can't understand your attitude at all!
It seems you'll be happy only when this news is out, your desire will be fulfilled only when my reputation is tarnished.
Otherwise, why do you keep saying day and night that the news will come out?
I don't see any reason why it should.
I feel, if somehow the news doesn't become public, you yourself will go from door to door and spread it!"

The minister said, "Your Majesty, please forgive me.
You understand everything much better than I do.
It is very presumptuous of a simpleton like me to offer you advice.
However, you chose me to be your minister, so I occasionally share my humble thoughts with you.
If my advice angers you, then please relieve me of this responsibility."

Pratapaditya straightened up.
Whenever the minister spoke a few harsh words to him, Pratapaditya felt satisfied in his mind.

Pratapaditya said, "I am thinking, if we kill those two Pathans, there will be no more reason to fear in this matter."

The minister said, "It is difficult to suppress one murder, it is impossible to handle three murders.
The subjects will come to know about it."
The minister stuck to his words.

Pratapaditya exclaimed, "Then I am relieved!
The subjects will come to know!
Jashore is not Raigarh; here the subjects do not rule.
Here, except for the king, everyone else is a subject.
Therefore, do not scare me with the fear of the subjects.
If any subject speaks against me in this matter, I will burn his tongue with hot iron."

The minister smiled to himself.
He thought to himself, "He is so afraid of his subjects' tongues.
Yet he keeps telling his mind that he doesn't fear any of his subjects!"

Pratapaditya: "After the shraddha and peace ceremonies are over, I must go to Raigarh once with my men.
I don't see anyone else as the heir to the throne there except me."

Old Basanta Ray slowly entered the house—Pratapaditya was startled and stepped back.
Suddenly he thought, perhaps it is a demigod.
He was so surprised that he couldn't say a word.
Basanta Ray went near him and gently caressed his body and said in a soft voice—"Why are you afraid of me, Pratap?
I am your paternal uncle.
Even if you don't believe that, I am old, I don't have the strength to harm you."

Pratapaditya came to his senses, but he was utterly inept at making up stories.
He stood there dumbfounded, without uttering a word.
He didn't even bow down to his paternal uncle.

Basanta Ray again slowly said, "Pratap, whatever it is, say something.
If by chance you have done something that makes you feel ashamed or embarrassed to see me, then don't worry about it.
I will not bring up the matter.
Come, my son; let us embrace each other once.
We have met after a long time today; and we may not meet again for a long time."

After a while, Pratapaditya paid his respects and got up to embrace his paternal uncle.
In the meantime, the minister quietly left the house.
Basanta Ray put his hand on Pratapaditya's shoulder and said with a gentle smile, "Basanta Ray has lived for a long time—haven't I, Pratap?
The time has come, God knows why the call hasn't come yet.
But there will be no more delay."

Basanta Ray remained silent for a while, Pratapaditya did not reply.
Basanta Ray spoke again, "Then I will say everything clearly.
You have hurt me more than the knife you raised against me.
(Tears welled up in his eyes as he spoke)
But I am not angry at all.
I will only tell you two things.
Do not kill me, Pratap!
It will not be good for your present and future life.
If you have been able to wait for my death for so long, can't you wait for two more days?
Will you become a sinner for this small piece of land?"

Basanta Ray noticed that Pratapaditya did not give any reply; he did not deny the accusation or express any regret; he immediately changed the topic and said, "Pratap, let's go to Raigarh once.
It's been a long time since you've been there.
You'll see many changes.
The soldiers have now left their swords and taken up the plough; where the soldiers used to live, there are now guest houses—"

At that moment Pratapaditya saw from a distance that the Pathan was trying to escape.
He could not hold himself back any longer.
The pent-up anger that was seething inside him erupted like a volcano.
He thundered, "Don't you dare let him go.
Catch him and hold him."
Saying this, he rushed out of the room.

The king called the minister and said, "Your great negligence in the affairs of the state has been noticed."

The minister said slowly, "Your Majesty, I am not at fault in this matter."

Pratapaditya exclaimed, "Am I talking about something else!
I am saying that your extreme negligence in state affairs has been noticed.
The other day I gave you a letter to keep, and you lost it!"

A similar incident had happened about one and a half months ago, but at that time the king did not say anything to the minister.

"The other day I ordered you to go to Umesh Rai, but you sent someone else to do the job!
Be quiet!
Don't try to cover up your mistakes!
Anyway, I am telling you, you are not paying any attention to the affairs of the state."

The king summoned the guards.
Earlier, he had deducted the salary of the night guards, now he ordered their imprisonment.

Going inside the palace, he called his queen and said, "Oh queen!
I see a lot of indiscipline within the royal family!
Udayaditya wasn't like this before.
Now he goes out whenever he wants.
He engages with the subjects' work.
He acts against me.
What is the meaning of all this?"

The queen said fearfully, "Maharaj, it's not his fault!
The root of all this trouble is that elder daughter-in-law!
My son wasn't like this before.
I can't understand what happened to Uday since the day he got married to the girl from Shreepur."

The queen ordered Surma to behave and went outside.
The queen sent for Udayaditya.
When Udayaditya arrived, she looked at his face and said, "Alas, my dear son, you have become so thin and dark!
How fair you were before your marriage!
You were like molten gold!
Who has done this to you?
My son, don't listen to what your elder wife tells you.
Your condition has become like this only by listening to her."
Surma stood silently to one side with her veil covering her face.
The queen continued, "She was born in a lowly family, how can she be your equal?
Does she know how to advise you?
I am telling you the truth, she never gives you good advice.
She only thrives when you suffer!
The king married you to such a demoness!"
The queen started shedding tears.

Beads of sweat appeared on Udayaditya's calm forehead.
He turned his oblong eyes away, lest his impatience be revealed.

An old, elderly maidservant was sitting there, she waved her hand and exclaimed, "The women of Shreepur know magic.
They must have given your son some potion."
Saying this, she got up and went to Udayaditya and said, "Son, she has given you some potion.
That girl you see, she is no ordinary girl!
She is from a Shreepur household.
They are witches!
Alas, what is left of your son's body?"
Saying this, she cast a sharp glance at Surma and rubbed her two dry eyes with her veil, turning them red.
Seeing this, the queen's grief welled up again.
Among the elderly women of the harem, the contagion of crying spread.
With the intention of crying, everyone came to the queen's chamber and gathered.
Udayaditya looked at Surma's face once with compassionate eyes.
Surma saw it from under her veil, and wiping her eyes, she slowly walked into the room without saying a word.

In the evening, the queen said to Pratapaditya, "Today I explained everything to Uday.
My son is not like that.
If you explain things to him, he understands.
Today he has realized his mistake."

## Chapter 6

Seeing Bibha's gloomy face, Surma could not hold herself back anymore; she held her by the throat and said, "Bibha, why are you keeping quiet?
When something is on your mind, why don't you say it?"

Bibha said slowly, "What else can I say?"

Surma said, "You haven't seen him in a long time, how can your heart not yearn for him!
Why don't you write him a letter asking him to come?
I'll arrange for your brother to send it."

Bibha is talking about her husband, Ramchandra Ray, the lord of Chandradwip.

Bibha, hanging her head, said, "If no one here acknowledges him, if no one here considers it necessary to invite him, then it's better if he doesn't come here.
If he comes on his own, I will forbid it.
He is a king, why should he come to a place where he is not respected?
Is he inferior to us that his father would insult him?"
As she spoke, Bibha could no longer control herself, her face turned red and she burst into tears.

Surma wiped Bibha's tears with her veil and said, "Alright, Bibha, if you were a man, what would you have done?
Would you not have gone to your in-laws' house just because you didn't receive an invitation?"

Bibha exclaimed, "No, I couldn't do that.
If I were a man, I would have left by now; I wouldn't care about honor or disgrace.
But having said that, why would he come if I didn't call him affectionately?"

Bibha had never spoken so much before.
Today, in the heat of the moment, she had said a lot.
Now she felt a little ashamed.
She thought, I have said too much.
And again, the way I said it, I feel very ashamed.
Gradually, the excitement in her mind subsided and a heavy depression slowly began to weigh on her mind.
Bibha covered her face with her arms and lay down on Surma's lap; Surma bowed her head and gently parted her thick hair with her soft hands!
How long did this go on?
Neither of them said a word.
Tears were falling from Bibha's eyes one by one and Surma was wiping them away gently.

After a long time, when the evening came, Bibha slowly got up and sat down, wiping away her tears and smiling slightly.
The meaning of that smile was - "What childishness have I done today!"
Gradually, she turned her face away and tried to slip away and run away.
Surma held her hand without saying anything.
Without bringing up the previous matter again, she said, "Bibha, have you heard that your granduncle has arrived?"

Bibha: "Has granduncle arrived?"

Surma.
"Yes."

Bibha asked with interest, "When did you come?"

Surma.
"It's almost four prahars of the night."

Bibha: "He hasn't come to see us yet."

Bibha felt a tinge of resentment in her mind.
Bibha is very cautious about taking possession of her grandfather.
One day, Basanta Ray talked to Udayaditya for a long time and made Bibha wait in the harem for three hours, but he did not meet her at all.
Bibha was so hurt by this that although she did not say anything about it, she could not talk to her grandfather with a happy face.

Basanta Ray entered the room and started singing with a smile;—

"I came to see you today after a long time!

Fear not, be happy,

I won't stay much longer

I have come for a moment!

I will just see the face

Listen to two sweet melodies

Seeing the smile from behind the veil, I will leave for a foreign land!”

Upon hearing the song, Bibha smiled with her head bowed.
She was very delighted.
She was embarrassed, lest her excessive delight be noticed.

Surma lifted Bibha's face and said, "Uncle, didn't you have to hide to see Bibha's smile?"

Basanta Ray.
"No. Bibha thought, if the old man doesn't leave without laughing, then let me laugh a little.
I understand that witch's intention very well, she is trying to get rid of me!
But that's not happening anytime soon.
If I came, I will leave after causing a lot of trouble, and I will be remembered for as long as we don't meet again!"

Surma said with a smile, "Look, Dada Mahashay, Bibha whispered in my ear that if you have the intention, then what you have already done is enough, and you don't need to do anything more."

Upon hearing this, Basanta Ray was very amused.
He started laughing.

Bibha, taken aback, exclaimed, "No, I never said that.
I didn't say anything."

Surma said, "Granduncle, your wish has been fulfilled!
You wanted to see a smile, you saw it, you wanted to hear words, you heard them too, now go to a foreign land."

Basanta Ray.
"No brother, I couldn't do that!
I have brought a whole lot of songs and a head full of grey hair, I can't leave without getting rid of all of them!"

Bibha could not hold back any longer, she burst out laughing and said, "Granduncle, you don't even have half a head full of hair!"

Grandfather's plan succeeded.
After many days, Bibha needed some preparation to speak for the first time in the meeting, but once Bibha opened her mouth in front of Grandfather, it took even more preparation to make her stop.
However, Bibha never opened her mouth in front of anyone except Grandfather, under any circumstances.

Basanta Ray, stroking his beard, said, "I went there once, brother!
When Basanta Ray had a lot of hair on his head, would I have walked all this way to flatter you so that you would be happy?
If a single strand of hair turned gray, I would become a candidate to marry five beautiful women like you and, with great enthusiasm, I would have plucked ten gray hairs!"

Bibha asked in a serious tone, "Well granduncle, when you had a full head of hair, did you look better than you do now?"

Bibha had serious doubts about it in her mind.
Grandfather's bald head, his wide smile with no mustache, his face like a ripe mango, she tried to change it in her mind, but it didn't look good at all.
She saw that her grandfather didn't look good without a bald head.
And if you add a mustache, Grandfather's face looks completely bad.
It gets so bad that she can't help but laugh when she imagines it.
Grandfather's mustache again!
Grandfather has no hair again!

Basanta Ray said, "There are many different opinions on that matter.
My granddaughters are fascinated by my money, they have not seen my baldness.
My grandmothers were fascinated by my abundant hair, they did not see my baldness.
Those who have seen both, have not yet been able to come to a conclusion."

Bibha said, "But having said that, if grandfather spends more money than he should, it won't look good!"

Surma said, "Granduncle will discuss the money later.
Right now, please find a way to help Bibha!"

Bibha hurriedly went to Basanta Ray and said, "Granduncle—I will pluck out your gray hair."

Surma.
"I say, what if—"

Bibha: "Listen, granduncle, your—"

Surma: "Bibha, be quiet.
Let me tell you, you go and just once—"

Bibha: "Granduncle, except for the gray hair on your head, there's nothing else.
If you pull it off, your entire head will be bald!"

Basanta Ray.
"If you don't let me speak sister, if you keep bothering me, then I will sing a raga of anger."

Saying this, he started to tune the pegs of his small-sized sitar.
Bibha had a particular aversion to the Hindustani raga.

Bibha said, "What a disaster."
Saying this, she ran out of the house.

Then Surma said with a serious tone, "If the Maharaj came to know about the pain Bibha silently endures day and night, I think he would have felt pity!"

"Why!
Why!
What happened to him!"
Saying this, Basanta Ray went and sat near Surma with utmost concern.

Surma said, "In a whole year, does it not occur to anyone to invite the Thakurjamai?"

Basanta Ray said after thinking, "That's right!"

Surma said, "How many women can tolerate such disrespect from their husbands?
Bibha is a good person, that's why she doesn't say anything to anyone, she hides and cries in her mind."

Basanta Ray anxiously exclaimed, "Why are you hiding and crying?"

Surma: "She was crying so much in front of me this afternoon."

Basanta Ray.
"Was Bibha crying this afternoon?"

Surma.
"Yes!"

Basanta Ray.
"Ah, call her once, let me see!"

Surma brought Bibha.
Basanta Ray held her chin and said, "Why are you crying, sister?
Why don't you tell your grandfather when you are in trouble?
Then I will do my best.
I will go right now and tell Pratap!"

Bibha exclaimed, "Granduncle, I fall at your feet, please don't tell my father about me.
Granduncle, I fall at your feet, please don't go!"

Saying this, Basanta Ray went outside; he went to Pratapaditya and said, "You haven't invited your son-in-law for a long time, and this shows utter disregard towards him.
If the son-in-law of the lord of Jashore is not given due respect, then it is an insult to you.
There is no glory in that."

Pratapaditya did not disagree at all with his uncle's words.
He ordered his men to send the invitation letter to Chandradwip.

Inside the palace, Basanta Ray's sitar playing created a stir as he sat down next to Bibha and Surma.

"May a faint smile blossom on your pale face, may your two eyes fill with joy!"

Bibha said, feeling shy, "Uncle, have you told Father everything about me?"
Basanta Ray started singing a song,

"A faint smile on a gloomy face, two eyes filled with tears.

Discard your dirty clothes, my friend, and wear ornaments.

Bibha stopped the sitar by placing her hand on its strings and asked again, "Did you talk to father about me?"

At that moment, Udayaditya's youngest son, eight-year-old Samaraditya, peeped into the room and said, "Oh, sister!
You are chatting with granduncle!
I am going to tell mother."

"Come, come, brother come!"
saying Basanta Ray caught hold of him.

The royal family believes that Basanta Ray and Surma conspired to destroy Udayaditya.
Therefore, whenever Basanta Ray comes, he is treated with great caution.
Samaraditya started flattering Basanta Ray in order to get rid of him.
Basanta Ray, using his sitar, made him sit on his shoulders, made him wear spectacles, and within two hours, brought him under his control in such a way that he started following granduncle around all day and kept playing the sitar, breaking five of its strings and snatching away the plectrum and not returning it!

## Chapter 7

King Ramchandra Ray of Chandradwip is sitting in his royal chamber.
The room is octagonal.
A chandelier covered with cloth from top to bottom is hanging.
In one of the niches in the wall, there is an idol of Ganesha and in the rest, there are various forms and incarnations of Lord Krishna.
They are all handcrafted by the famous craftsman Batkrishna Kumbhakar.
There are sheets all around, a gold-embroidered masland mat in the center, a royal seat, and a bolster on it.
There are gold tassels at its four corners.
Local mirrors are hung all around the walls, but one cannot see their face clearly in them.
The king cannot see his face clearly in the human mirrors around him either, his body appears disproportionately large.
To the left of the king is a huge hookah and the minister Harishankar.
To the right of the king are the jester Ramai and the bespectacled commander Fernandes.

The king said, "Oh Ramai!"

Ramai said, "Yes, Your Majesty!"

The king laughed heartily.
The minister laughed even more than the king.
Fernandis clapped his hands and burst out laughing.
With joy, Ramai's eyes started twinkling.
The king thought that if he didn't laugh at Ramai's words, it would be seen as a lack of appreciation; the minister thought that since the king was laughing, he should also laugh; Fernandis thought that there was definitely something to laugh about.
Besides, such was Ramai's misfortune that whenever he opened his mouth, instead of making people laugh, he made them cry.
Otherwise, very few people would laugh with joy after hearing Ramai's jokes, which were as old as Methuselah.
However, out of fear and a sense of duty, everyone laughed uproariously, starting from the king to the doorkeeper.

The king asked, "What is the news?"

Ramai thought it was necessary to crack a joke.

"It was heard through tradition that there was a theft at Senapati's house."

The commander became impatient.
He understood that an old story was being tried to be passed off on him.
Just as he was afraid of Ramai's wit, Ramai similarly always suppressed him.
The king was greatly amused!
As soon as Ramai came, he would send for Fernandis.
The king had two main amusements in life; one was watching ram fights, and the other was placing Fernandis in front of Ramai.
Since entering the king's service, the commander had not been touched by a single bullet or arrow.
That person had come to be in tears after being constantly pelted with laughter bullets.
I beg the reader's pardon, we will not be able to record all of Ramai's witticisms, at the request of good taste, most of the places will have to be abandoned.

The king blinked and asked, "Then what?"

"I beg to report, Your Majesty!
(Fernandez started to unbutton his coat and take it off.)
For the past three or four days, there has been a thief sneaking around Senapati's house at night.
The Saheb's Brahmin wife found out and tried to wake him up, but she couldn't break his sleep."

King.
"Ha ha ha ha."

Minister: "Sigh. Sigh.
Sigh.
Sigh.
Sigh.
Sigh. Sigh."

Senapati: "Hee hee."

"Unable to bear the torture of his wife during the day, he folded his hands and said, "I beg you, I will catch the thief tonight."
At two o'clock in the night, the housewife said, "Oh, the thief has come!"
The master said, "Oh yes, there is a light in the room!
The thief will see us and run away."
He called the thief and said, "You had a close call today.
There is light in the room, so you can escape safely today.
I will come tomorrow and see if you can be caught in the dark."

The king "Ha ha ha ha!"

Minister "Hohohohoho!"

Senapati: "Yes."

The king said, "Then what?"

Ramai saw that the king was still not satisfied.
"I don't know why he wasn't scared enough of the thief.
He even came back to the house at night."
The mistress said, "Everything is ruined, get up."
The master said, "You don't get up!"
The mistress said, "What will I do if I get up?"
The master said, "Why; don't you light a lamp in the house.
I can't see anything!"
The mistress was very angry; the master got even more angry and said, "Look, look, everything is gone because of you.
Light the lamp, bring the gun!"
In the meantime, the thief finished his work and said, "Sir, can you give me a chillum to smoke!
I've worked very hard."
The master threatened him and said, "Get lost, you rascal!
I'll fix you a chillum.
But if you come near me, I'll blow your head off with this gun."
After smoking the chillum, the thief said, "Sir, it would be helpful if you lit the lamp.
The chisel has fallen somewhere and I can't find it."
The commander said, "The rascal is scared.
Stay where you are, don't come near me."
Saying this, he quickly lit the lamp.
The thief slowly and steadily packed his things and left.
The master said to the mistress, "The rascal was very scared."

The king and the minister could not control their laughter.
Fernandes, now and then, burst into peals of laughter.

The king said, "Ramai, have you heard that I am going to my in-laws' house?"

Ramai said with a wry smile, "Life is futile, only the in-laws' house is meaningful (laughs).
First the king, then the minister, then the commander-in-chief.)
The saying is not false.
(Sighs) Everything in the in-laws' house is meaningful—the food, the respect; you get a bowl of milk, you get a piece of fish; all meaningful things.
Only that wife is the most futile of all!"

The king said with a smile, "Who is that, your better half?"

With folded hands, Romai anxiously said, "Your Majesty, don't call her your better half.
If I perform penance for three lifetimes, then perhaps I can become her better half, I have such hope.
Even if you combine five better halves like me, they won't be equal to her!"
(Laughter all around) Everyone else understood the humor in the statement, only the minister didn't, which is why the minister had to laugh the most.

The king said, "But I have heard that your Brahmin wife is very calm in nature and is especially skilled in household chores."

Ramai: "What's the use of talking about it!
The house is full of all sorts of junk, only I can't stay there.
In the morning, the housewife sweeps the house so much that I end up right at the king's doorstep."

Here, in the context of the story, I will introduce Ramai's Brahmin wife.
She is extremely thin and is gradually becoming thinner day by day.
When Ramai comes home, she wonders where she will find shelter.
In the royal court, Ramai shows his teeth in one way and when he comes home, he shows his teeth in another way to his wife.
But if I were to describe the true nature of his wife, it would not be funny but rather pitiful.
That is why, in the royal court, Ramai describes his wife as being fat and fierce, and the king and the ministers cannot help but laugh!

After the laughter subsided, the king said, "O Ramai, you have to go, take the commander with you as well."

The commander understood that now Ramai would launch a second attack on him.
He put on his glasses and started to unbutton and button up his coat.

Ramai said, "The commander cannot have any objection to going to the festival grounds, because this is not a battlefield!"

The king and the minister thought, a very interesting matter is coming; they asked with interest, "Why?"

Ramai: "The sahib wears glasses day and night.
He even wears them when he sleeps; otherwise, he cannot dream properly.
The commander has no other objection to going to war, except that he is afraid that a cannonball might hit the lens of his glasses, breaking them and blinding him.
What a man!"

The commander blinked and said, "Isn't that so?"
He got up from his seat and said, "Your Majesty, if you command, I shall take my leave."

The king told the commander to prepare for the journey, "Make all the arrangements for the journey.
My sixty-four-oared boat should be ready."
The minister and the commander left.

The king said, "Ramai, you have heard everything.
Last time at your father-in-law's place, they really humiliated me?"

Ramai: "Yes, your highness, I made the Maharaja's ring."

The king laughed, the lightning of his teeth flashed, but a dark cloud gathered in his mind.
He was not very happy to hear that Ramai had come to know about this news.
It would not have been so bad if someone else had known.
He started smoking incessantly.

Ramai said, "One of your brothers-in-law came and told me that your king's tail was revealed in the bridal chamber; is he Ramachandra, Ramadas?
I didn't know that before."
I immediately said, "How would you know before?
It wasn't there before.
He came to your house to get married, so he adopted the customs of the country he was in."

The king was very happy to hear the reply!
He thought that Ramai had brought glory to him and his ancestors and that Pratapaditya's sun had been eclipsed forever.
The king was not much of a warrior.
He considered these minor incidents to be as serious as a war.
For so long, he had believed that he had suffered a humiliating defeat.
The thought of this disgrace haunted him day and night, and he would ask the earth to swallow him up out of shame.
Today, his mind was somewhat comforted by the news that General Ramai had returned victorious from the battle.
But even then, the burden of shame did not completely lift from his mind.

The king said to Ramai, "Ramai, this time you have to go and win.
If you win, I will give you my ring as a gift."

Ramai said, "What is the king thinking about?
If Ramai can be taken to the women's quarters, then I can even make the queen mother herself drink the bhang with pleasure."

The king said, "What is her worry?
I will take you inside the palace."

Ramai said, "What is impossible for you?"

The king also believes that.
What can't he do?
If any of his loyal subjects says, "May the king be victorious, fulfill the desire of your servant."
His Majesty Ramchandra Ray immediately says, "Yes, it shall be done."
Let no one think that there is anything that he cannot do.
He decided that he would take the jester Ramai to Pratapaditya's harem and make fun of the queen mother herself.
Only then would he be worthy of the name Raja Ramchandra Ray.
If he could do such a great deed, then what kind of king would he be otherwise?

The king of Chandradwip sent for Rammohan Mal.
Rammohan Mal was as strong as Bhima in prowess.
His body was about four and a half hands long.
His whole body was rippling with muscles.
He was a man from the time of the heavenly king.
He had been raising Ramchandra since childhood.
Everyone is afraid of Ramai, if Ramai is afraid of anyone, then it is this Rammohan.
Rammohan hated Ramai very much.
Ramai used to shrink in his hateful eyes.
He would not let go if he could avoid Rammohan's gaze.
Rammohan came and stood.
The king said that fifty of his followers would go with him.
Rammohan will be their leader.

Rammohan said, "As you command, will Ramai Thakur go?"
The cat-eyed, deformed Ramai Thakur became embarrassed.

## Chapter 8

Today, the employees of Jashore's royal palace are very busy.
The son-in-law is coming, so various arrangements need to be made.
Extensive arrangements are being made for food and drinks.
Pratapaditya and his queen had no differences of opinion regarding the fact that the royal family of Chandradwip is utterly insignificant compared to Jashore, yet the queen is very delighted today because her son-in-law is coming.
Since morning, she has started decorating Bibha with her own hands—Bibha is in a great deal of confusion.
Because there are differences of opinion between the elderly mother and the young daughter regarding the method of decoration, but what can be done, the queen definitely knows what is best for Bibha.
Bibha had the idea in her mind that if she wore thin turquoise bangles of three inches each, her white, tender hands would look very beautiful;—the queen made her wear thick gold bangles of eight inches each and large diamond earrings of one inch each and became so happy that she called all the old maidservants and widowed aunts of the house to show them.
Bibha knew that a nose ring would not suit her small, delicate face at all—but the queen made her wear a large nose ring and proudly started examining her face, turning it first to the right and then to the left.
Bibha remained silent even at this, but she became completely intolerant of the way the queen tied her hair.
She secretly went to Surma and got her hair tied the way she liked.
But that did not escape the queen's notice.
The queen saw that Bibha's entire decoration was ruined just because of the way her hair was tied.
She could clearly see that Surma had tied Bibha's hair badly out of jealousy;—she tried to open Bibha's eyes to Surma's mean intention;—after scolding for a long time, when she was convinced that she had succeeded, she untied her hair and tied it again!
In this way, Bibha is feeling very embarrassed, carrying the burden of her bun, her nose ring, the bangles that fill both her arms, and her heart full of joy.
She realizes that she is not able to keep her overwhelming joy confined within the palace, it keeps peeping out of her eyes and face like lightning.
She feels that even the walls of the house are trying to mock her.
Crown prince Udayaditya came and saw Bibha's shy, joyful face with deep affection and calm happiness.
Seeing Bibha's joy, he was so happy that he went home and kissed Surma with a gentle, loving smile.

Surma asked, "What?"

Udayaditya said, "Nothing!"

At that moment, Basanta Ray forcibly dragged Bibha inside the room and presented her.
Holding her chin, he lifted her face and said, "Look, Dada, just look at your Bibha's face today!
Surma,—oh
Surma, come and see once!"
The old man started laughing with joy.
Looking at Bibha's face, he said, "It's delightful, you are laughing so well, my dear, let me see!"

"How will you hold (my) feet while laughing,

The desire of that smile plays on those lips!”

If I wasn't so old, I would have looked at your face and died right here!
Alas, alas, I am too old to die!
In my youth, I would have died every moment.
In old age, one doesn't die unless one is sick!"

When Pratapaditya's brother-in-law came and asked him, "Who has gone to welcome the son-in-law?"
He said, "How do I know!"
"Should we light up the streets today?"
The Maharaja said with wide eyes, "Of course we should, there's no question about it!"
Then the brother-in-law hesitantly said, "Will the naubat (traditional music) be played?"
"I don't have time to think about all that."
The truth is, it is not Pratapaditya's job to bring a son-in-law home with fanfare.

Ramchandra Ray's great pride has been hurt.
He has decided that he has been deliberately insulted.
Earlier, whenever he was invited, people from the palace used to come to Chakdihi to receive him, but this time, after crossing Chakdihi and traveling two **kro**sh, Dewanji came to receive him at Bamunhati.
Even if Dewanji came, why didn't he bring at least two hundred and fifty people with him?
Why, couldn't they find fifty people in the whole of Jashore?
The elephant that has come to take the king is as huge as the jester Ramai.
Dewanji is even bigger than the elephant.
Ramai asked Dewanji, "Sir, is the elephant your younger brother?"
The kind-hearted Dewanji was a little surprised and replied, "No, that's an elephant."

The king, getting angry, said to the minister, "The elephant that your minister rides is even bigger than this."

The Dewan said, "The big elephants have been sent far away for royal work, there is not even one in the city."

Ramchandra decided that they were sent away just to insult him.
Otherwise, what other reason could there be!

King of kings Ramchandra Ray, becoming furious, said, taking his father-in-law's name, "In what way am I inferior to Pratapaditya Ray?"

Ramai the jester said, "In age and relation, otherwise what else?
You have married his daughter, so—"

Nearby, Rammohan Mal was standing.
He couldn't bear it anymore.
He became very angry and said, "Look Thakur, your pride has grown too much.
Don't talk about my mother Karun in such a way.
I am saying this very clearly."

Looking at Pratapaditya, Ramai said, "I have seen many, many suns like that.
Do you know, Your Majesty, that the person who can hold the sun in his armpit is a servant of Ramachandra."

The king smiled wryly.
Rammohan then slowly approached the king and said with folded hands, "Your Majesty, I cannot bear that the Brahmin should say whatever he wants in the name of your father-in-law; please tell me to shut his mouth."

The king said, "Rammohan, you stop."

Then Rammohan went away from there.

That day, Ramchandra pondered over thousands of minute details and concluded that Pratapaditya had been planning to insult him for a long time.
He was extremely puffed up with pride.
He decided to present himself before Pratapaditya in such a way that Pratapaditya would understand how important his son-in-law was.

When Pratapaditya met Ramchandra Ray, Pratapaditya was sitting in the royal court with his minister.
As soon as he saw Pratapaditya, Ramchandra came slowly with his head bowed and greeted him.

Pratapaditya said calmly without showing any excitement or nervousness, "Come in.
Are you well?"

Ramchandra said in a soft voice, "Yes, sir."

Pratapaditya looked at the minister and said, "Have you investigated the complaint that has come against the tahsildar of Bhanga-mathi pargana?"

The minister took out a long paper and handed it to the king.
The king started reading it.
After reading for some time, he looked up and asked the minister, "Unlike last year, there was no flood in your area this year, was there?"

Ramchandra: "No, sir.
Once in the month of Ashwin, the water level rises—"

Pratapaditya - "Minister, a copy of this letter must have been kept."
Saying this, he started reading again.
After finishing reading, he said to his son-in-law, "Go, son, go to the women's quarters."

Ramchandra got up slowly.
He understood how Pratapaditya was superior to him.

## Chapter 9

When Rammohan Mal came to the women's quarters and bowed to Bibha, saying, "Mother, I came to see you for a moment," Bibha felt very happy.
She loved Rammohan very much.
Bearing the burden of various family responsibilities, Rammohan would come to Jashore from Chandradwip every now and then.
Even if there was no particular need, he would come to see Bibha whenever he had some free time.
Bibha did not feel shy around Rammohan at all.
When the old, strong, tall Rammohan would come and stand before her, saying, "Mother," there would be such a pure, simple, unadorned affection in his demeanor that Bibha would feel like a little girl in front of him.
Bibha said to him, "Mohan, why haven't you come in so long?"

Rammohan said, "Oh mother, 'Even if there is a bad son, there is never a bad mother,' what did you think of me?
I said in my mind, I will not go if she does not call me mother; let's see, how many days it takes for her to remember!
But alas, she did not remember even once!"

Bibha found herself in a difficult situation.
She couldn't explain properly why she didn't call out to him.
Besides, she felt that there was a flaw in the logic that just because she didn't call out to him, it meant that she didn't think about him.
However, she couldn't explain it properly.

Seeing Bibha's predicament, Rammohan said with a smile, "No, I couldn't come because I didn't get the time."

Bibha said, "Mohan, you sit down; tell me stories of your country."

Rammohan sat down.
He began to describe Chandradwip.
Bibha listened attentively, her hand on her cheek.
As she listened to the description of Chandradwip, who knows how many fancies arose in her heart, how many houses and buildings she built in the sky that day.
When Rammohan told the story of how his house and belongings had been washed away in last year's floods; how he had carried his old mother on his back and swum to the top of the temple in the twilight; and how the two of them had spent the whole night there—then Bibha's little heart trembled.

After the story was over, Rammohan said, "Mother, I have brought four conch shell bangles for you, you have to wear them on that hand, I will see."

Bibha took off her four gold bangles and put on conch shell bangles, and laughing she went to her mother and said, "Mother, Mohan took off your bangles and made me wear four conch shell bangles."

The queen, without showing any displeasure, said with a smile, "Yes, it suits her well, it looks good on her."

Rammohan became very excited and proud.
His wife called him and took him with her, and she herself stayed there and made him eat.
After he ate to his satisfaction, she became very pleased and said, "Mohan, now sing that song of your arrival."
Rammohan looked towards Bibha and sang;—

"Look, mother, all year long, mother, you are my kind of stream,

My eyes lost their stars and became blind, O my stars!

Is she made of stone, oh!

I will see you at dawn,

That mother does not stop at anything, the stream of tears from these eyes is burning!”

Tears came to Rammohan's eyes, his wife also looked at Bibha's face and wiped away her tears.
The song of Agomoni reminded her of Bijoya.

Gradually, the evening arrived.
The crowd of women in the city started to return home.
The neighbors came to the women's quarters to see the son-in-law and to tease him according to their relationship.
Bibha's heart was pounding with joy, shame, fear, an uncertain, unknown feeling, her face and ears turned red, and her hands and feet became cold.
Who knows if this is pain or happiness!

The son-in-law has arrived in the women's quarters.
A bevy of beautiful women, resembling a flock of swans, has attacked him from all sides.
Laughter and noise filled the air.
From all sides, sharp taunts from melodious voices, harsh slaps from jasmine-like arms, and sharp scratches from the moon-like nails of champaka flowers began to rain down on him.
When Ramchandra Ray was completely overwhelmed, an elderly woman came and took his side.
She began to speak in a harsh voice, uttering such sharp and cutting words, and gradually such vulgar obscenities began to flow from her mouth that the mouths of the city women were practically shut.
Even the elder sister-in-law fell silent before her.
Bimaladidi got up and left the room.
Only Bhuta's mother gave her a piece of her mind.
When the aforementioned Bhuta's mother was speaking very volubly, the elderly woman said to her, "Oh mother, your mouth is not a mouth, it's a broom!"
Bhuta's mother immediately retorted, "And your mouth, my dear, is a garbage dump.
I've swept it so much, but it still hasn't been cleaned!"
and she left, muttering and grumbling.
One by one, the room emptied, and Ramchandra Ray got some respite!

Then that old woman came out of the house and went to the queen's chamber.
There the queen was feeding the maidservants.
Rammohan was also sitting on one side, eating.
The old woman came to the queen, looked at her, and said, "Oh, you wicked mother!"
Hearing this, Rammohan was startled and looked at the old woman's face.
Immediately, he abandoned his meal, jumped up like a tiger, grabbed her two hands with his iron fists, and said in a thunderous voice, "I know you, you wretch!"
Saying this, he pulled off the cloth from her head.
It was none other than Ramai Thakur!
Rammohan began to tremble with anger, threw off the sheet from his body, and effortlessly lifted Ramai into the air with both hands, saying, "Today, you will die by my hands!"
Saying this, he spun her around in the air once or twice.
The queen rushed forward and said, "Rammohan, what are you doing?"
Ramai said in a plaintive voice, "Please, father, don't kill me!"
A terrible commotion arose from all sides.
Then Rammohan lowered Ramai to the ground and said, trembling, "Wretch, was there no other place for you to die?"

Ramai said, "The Maharaj has ordered me."
Rammohan shouted, "What did you say, you traitor?
If you say such a thing again, I will rub your face on this whetstone!"
Saying this, he grabbed his throat.

Ramai started wailing.
Then Rammohan tied the short-statured Ramai with a bedsheet, made her into a bundle and, hanging her, left the women's quarters.

Before long, the matter became a scandal.
It was past midnight.
The king's brother-in-law came and informed Pratapaditya that night that his son-in-law Ramai the jester had been taken inside the women's quarters dressed as a woman!
There he had mocked the ladies of the palace, even the queen.

Then Pratapaditya's appearance became very fearsome.
His whole body trembled with anger.
With his matted hair flowing, he got up from the bed like a lion and said, "Call Lachhman Sardar."
He told Lachhman Sardar, "Tonight I want to see Ramchandra Ray's severed head!"
He immediately saluted and said, "Yes, Your Majesty!"
Immediately his brother-in-law fell at his feet and said, "Your Majesty, please forgive me, think of Bibha once.
Don't do such a thing!"
Pratapaditya said again in a firm voice, "I want Ramchandra Ray's head by tonight!"
His brother-in-law held his feet and said, "Your Majesty, they are sleeping in the inner apartment tonight, please forgive me, Your Majesty, please forgive me!"
Then Pratapaditya remained silent for a while and said, "Listen Lachhman, tomorrow morning when Ramchandra Ray comes out of the inner apartment, kill him then, you are ordered."
The brother-in-law saw that things had gone much further than he had thought.
That night he came quietly and knocked on the door of Bibha's bedroom.

At that time, the sound of the two-hour watch is playing in the distance.
In the silent night, the sound of that watch, mixed with the moonlight and the south wind, is creating dreams in the sleeping soul.
Moonlight has fallen on the bed through the open balcony of Bibha's bedroom, Ramchandra Rai is fast asleep.
Bibha sat up and thought silently with her hand on her cheek.
Looking at the moonlight, a few drops of tears fell from her eyes.
It seems that what she had imagined did not happen exactly like that.
Her soul was crying inside her.
The day for which she had been waiting for so long has finally arrived today.

Ramchandra Ray has not spoken a single word to Bibha since he went to bed.
Pratapaditya has insulted him—how can he insult Pratap-Aditya?
Yes, by ignoring Bibha.
He wants to make her realize, "You are the daughter of Pratapaditya of Jashore, do you deserve to be beside Raja Ramchandra Ray, the ruler of Chandradweepa?"
Having decided this, he turned to his side and went to sleep and did not change his side again.
All his pride and ego were directed towards Bibha.
Bibha is sitting awake and thinking.
Sometimes she looks at the moonlight, sometimes she looks at her husband's face.
Her chest heaves and she sighs deeply—her heart is in great pain.
Suddenly, Ramchandra woke up.
He suddenly saw Bibha sitting silently and crying.
In the first moment of waking up from sleep, when the memory of the insult had not yet surfaced, when the mind had regained its composure after deep sleep, when the anger had subsided, he suddenly felt compassion for Bibha as he saw her tear-stained, pitiful young face.
Holding Bibha's hand, he said, "Bibha, why are you crying?"
Bibha became overwhelmed.
Bibha could not speak, Bibha could not see, Bibha fell down.
Then Ramchandra Ray got up and sat down, slowly took Bibha's head and placed it on his lap, and wiped away her tears.
Just then, someone knocked at the door.
Ramchandra said, "Who is it?"
The reply came from outside, "Open the door immediately!"

## Chapter 10

Ramchandra Ray opened the door of the bedroom and came out.
The royal priest Ramapati said, "Sir, run away now, don't delay even for a moment."

Upon hearing this suddenly that night, Ramchandra Ray was completely startled, his face turned pale, and he asked with bated breath, "Why, why, what happened?"

"I won't tell you what happened, run away now."

Bibha left her bed and came and asked, "Uncle, what happened?"

Rmapati said, "It's no use listening to you, mother!"

Bibha's heart started to cry.
She thought about Basanta Ray once, and Udayaditya once.
She said, "Uncle, what happened.
Tell me!"

Ramapati did not reply to his words and said to Ramchandra, "Son, there is no point in wasting time.
Find a way to escape secretly right now."

Suddenly, a terrible ominous fear arose in Bibha's mind.
She blocked her maternal uncle's path, who was about to leave, and said, "Oh, I beg you, please tell me what has happened!"

Romapati looked around fearfully and said, "Don't make a scene, Bibha, be quiet, I'm telling you everything!"

When Ramapati told her everything one by one, Bibha was about to scream out loud.
Ramapati quickly covered her mouth and said, "Hush, hush, don't ruin everything!"
Bibha sat down there with bated breath and a stifled voice.

Ramchandra Ray said in a worried tone, "What should I do now?
Is there any way to escape, I don't know anything!"

Rmapati said, "Tonight the guards are alert all around.
I will go and check around once to see if there is a way out anywhere."

Saying this, he started to leave.
Bibha held him and said, "Uncle, where are you going!
Don't go, stay with us."

Rmapati said, "Bibha, you have gone mad!
You won't see any benefit if I stay here.
In the meantime, I will go and see the situation around."

Bibha then stood up forcibly.
Her hands and feet were trembling.
She said, "Uncle, you stay here for a while.
I'll go to my brother once."
Saying this, Bibha quickly went to Udayaditya's bedroom and appeared.

By then, the waning moon was setting.
Darkness was creeping in from all sides.
There was no sound anywhere.
Ramchandra Ray stood at the door of his bedroom and saw that the doors of the row of rooms of the royal harem on both sides were closed, and everyone was sleeping peacefully.
The shadows of the walls on all four sides fell on the courtyard in front, and a little moonlight still lingered on one side.
Gradually, that too disappeared.
Darkness took over the entire world, one step at a time.
The darkness settled in among the rows of coconut trees in the distant garden.
The darkness came closer and stood right next to him!
Ramchandra Ray began to imagine that somewhere in this darkness, a dagger was waiting for him!
To the south or to the left, in front or behind?
In each of the corners that could be seen here and there, was someone hiding with their face covered and wrapped in a sheet?
Who knows if there was someone inside the room—under the bed or on one side of the wall!
His whole body shivered, and sweat poured down his forehead.
Once he thought, what if his maternal uncle did something, if he had some intention?
He slowly moved aside.
A gust of wind came and blew out the lamp in the room.
Ramchandra thought—someone must have blown out the lamp—someone must be in the room.
He went near Ramapati and called out, "Uncle."
His uncle said, "What is it, son?"
Ramchandra Ray thought to himself, it would have been better if Bibha was here, I don't trust my uncle.

Bibha went and fell at Udayaditya's feet, weeping profusely.
She couldn't utter a single word.
Surma lifted her up and asked, "What happened, Bibha?"
Bibha held Surma's hands tightly and couldn't say a word.
Udayaditya affectionately placed his hand on Bibha's head and said, "Why, Bibha, what happened?"
Bibha held her brother's hands and said, "Brother, come with me, you will hear everything."

The three of them went together and reached Bibha's bedroom door.
Ramchandra was sitting there in the dark, and Ramapati was standing.
Udayaditya asked hurriedly, "Uncle, what happened?"
Ramapati narrated the whole incident one by one.
Udayaditya widened his oblong eyes and looked at Surma and said, "I am going to father right now.
I will never let him do this!
Never!"

Surma said, "Will that bear any fruit?
Instead, why don't you send granduncle to him once, in case he sees some benefit."

The crown prince said, "Alright."

Basanta Ray was fast asleep at that time.
As soon as he woke up and saw Udayaditya, he thought it must be dawn.
He immediately started to sing a song in a low voice,—

"The flowers in the graveyard have withered, the flowers in the forest have bloomed in the forest,

The light of day has appeared, the desire of the heart remained in the heart!”

Udayaditya said, "Granduncle, a disaster has occurred."

Immediately Basanta Ray stopped singing.
He got up nervously and came to Udayaditya and asked him in a fluster, "Oh!
What is it Dada!
What happened!
What is the danger!"

Udayaditya narrated everything.
Basanta Ray sat up on the bed.
He shook his head as he looked at Udayaditya and said, "No, Dada, no, how can this ever happen?
Is this even possible?"

Udayaditya said, "There is no more time, go to your father once!"

Basanta Ray stood up, started walking, and asked repeatedly as he walked, "Dada, does this ever happen?
Is this ever possible?"

Upon entering Pratapaditya's house, he asked, "Baba Pratap, is this ever possible?"
Pratapaditya had not yet gone to his bedchamber—he was sitting in his council chamber.
For a moment, he thought of calling back Lachman Sardar!
But that decision was immediately dispelled from his mind.
Does Pratapaditya ever give an order twice?
To take back an order with the same mouth that gave it?
Playing games with orders is not his style.
But Bibha?
Bibha will become a widow.
Even if Ramchandra Ray had willingly jumped into the fire, Bibha would have become a widow—Ramchandra Ray has willingly jumped into the fire of Pratapaditya Ray's wrath, and as an inevitable consequence, Bibha will become a widow!
What role does Pratapaditya have in this!
But he didn't even think about all this.
Whenever the entire incident vividly comes to his mind, he becomes utterly restless, thinking, when will the night end?
Just then, old Basanta Ray entered the house in a hurry and anxiously held Pratapaditya's hands, saying, "Baba Pratap, is this ever possible?"

Pratapaditya flared up and said, "Why is it not possible?"

Basanta Ray said, "A child, immature, is he worthy of your anger?"

Pratapaditya exclaimed, "Child!
He is not old enough to understand that playing with fire will burn his hand!
A good-for-nothing, witless Brahmin from somewhere, who earns his living by showing off his teeth to fools, dressed him up as a woman and brought him to mock my queen; the one who could think of this much, couldn't think of what the consequences might be!
The sad part is, when he does realize the consequences, he won't have a head on his shoulders."
The more he spoke, the more his body trembled, his resolve grew stronger, and his impatience increased.

Basanta Ray shook his head and said, "Alas, that boy!
He doesn't understand anything!"

Pratapaditya became furious and said, "Look, paternal uncle, if you had any idea about what brings honor or dishonor to the Ray dynasty of Jashore, would you have let the Mughal emperor place a crown on your gray hair?
You walk around with your head held high because of the emperor's favor, while Pratapaditya's head hangs in shame.
You wear the dust of the Yavana's feet on your forehead.
I wanted to make that insignificant head of yours, covered in the dust of the Yavana's feet, roll in the dirt, but fate prevented it.
I am telling you this clearly.
You don't seem to understand how great an insult the Ray dynasty has suffered today.
You have come to beg for forgiveness for the one who has insulted the Ray dynasty today."

Basanta Ray then slowly said, — "Pratap, I understand; — once you pick up a knife, that knife seems to be bent on going after someone.
I moved away from its target and so another person has become its target.
Alright Pratap, if you have no mercy in your heart, if your hungry anger wants to devour someone, then let that be me!
Here is your uncle’s head; (saying this, Basanta Ray lowered his head) if you are pleased by taking this, then take it.
Bring the knife.
This head has no hair, this face has no youthful beauty; Yama has sent a letter of invitation, and the arrangements for that meeting are also complete.
(A faint line of a smile appeared on Basanta Ray's face.)
But think about this, Pratap, Bibha is our foster daughter, when tears will flow from her eyes—" saying this, Basanta Ray started crying with impatience and eagerness— "Finish me off, Pratap!
There is no happiness for me in life.
Finish me off before I see the tears in her eyes."

Pratapaditya had been silent all this while.
When Basanta Ray finished speaking, he slowly got up and left.
He understood that the matter had been revealed.
He went downstairs, called the guards and ordered them to immediately block the canal adjacent to the palace with large sal wood logs.
Ramchandra Ray's boat is in that canal.
He specifically warned the guards that no one should be allowed to leave the women's quarters tonight.

## Chapter 11

When Basanta Ray returned to the women's quarters, Bibha started crying as soon as she saw him.
Basanta Ray could not hold back his tears any longer, he held Udayaditya's hand and said, "Brother, please find a way out of this."
Ramchandra Ray became very impatient.
Then Udayaditya took his sword in his hand.
He said, "Come, follow me."
Everyone started walking together.
Udayaditya said, "Bibha, you stay here, you don't come."
Bibha did not listen.
Ramchandra Ray also said, "No, Bibha should come with us."
In that silent night, everyone started walking silently.
It seemed as if fear was spreading its invisible hands from all sides.
Ramchandra Ray started looking in front, behind and sideways.
He started suspecting his maternal uncle from time to time.
After crossing the women's quarters and reaching the door to go outside, Udayaditya saw that the door was closed.
Bibha said in a trembling voice, "Brother, the door to go downstairs is not closed.
Let's go there!"
Everyone headed in that direction.
They started going down the long dark stairs.
Ramchandra Ray felt that once he went down this stairs, no one would be able to come up again—maybe this is the pit of the snake Vasuki, this is the stairs to go to hell.
When the stairs ended, they went to the door and saw that it was closed.
Everyone slowly climbed up again.
All the ways to get out of the women's quarters were closed.
Everyone went from door to door, returning to each door two or three times.
All of them were closed.

When Bibha saw that there was no way to get out, she wiped away her tears.
She took her husband's hand and led him to their bedroom.
She stood firmly near the door and said in an unwavering voice, "I will see who can take you out of this room!
Wherever you go, I will go before you, I will see who can stop me!"
Udayaditya stood near the door and said, "No one can enter the room without killing me."
Surma said nothing and stood beside her husband.
Old Basanta Ray came and stood in front of everyone.
Uncle left slowly.
But Ramchandra Roy did not like this arrangement at all.
He thought, "The way I see Pratapaditya, he can do anything.
I don't think Bibha and Udayaditya can do anything by getting in the middle.
If I can somehow get out of this house, I will be saved."

After a while, Surma said to Udayaditya in a soft voice, "I don't think it will do any good if we just stand here; on the contrary, the more obstacles Father faces, the more determined he will become.
Tell me how we can escape from the palace tonight!"

Udayaditya looked at Surma's face for a while with a worried expression and said, "Then I'll go and try to use force!"

Surma firmly nodded her head in agreement and said, "Go."

Udayaditya threw off his upper garment and left.
Surma followed him for a short distance.
Reaching a secluded spot, she embraced Udayaditya.
Udayaditya bowed his head and gave her a long kiss; and within moments, he was gone.
Then Surma returned to her bedroom.
Tears streamed down her cheeks.
She clasped her hands and said, "Mother, if I am a chaste and faithful wife, then please save my husband from his father's clutches.
I have sent him into this danger today, relying only on you, Mother!
If you forsake me, who else in the world will believe in you?"
As she spoke, she began to weep.
Surma sat in the darkness and called out to her mother in her mind, "Mother, Mother!"
countless times, but it seemed as if her mother did not hear her words!
She offered flowers at her mother's feet in her mind, but it seemed as if her mother did not accept them; they fell from her feet.
Surma cried out, "Why, Mother, what have I done?"
She did not hear an answer.
In the darkness all around her, she saw the form of the apocalypse dancing!
Surma began to see emptiness all around her.
She could not bear to stay in that room alone any longer.
She went out and came to Bibha's room.

Basanta Ray said in a worried voice, "Brother hasn't returned yet, what will happen?"

Surma stood leaning against the wall and said, "Whatever God does!"

Ramchandra Ray was mentally cursing his old servant Rammohan!
Because, all these troubles started from him.
He was planning all sorts of punishments for him.
In between, he sometimes realized that he might not get the opportunity to punish him.

Udayaditya crossed the women's quarters with a sword in his hand and went to the closed door and kicked it hard—said, "Who's there?"

From outside came the reply, "Yes, I am Sitaram!"

The crown prince said in a firm voice, "Open the door quickly."

He opened the door immediately.
As Udayaditya started to leave, he said with folded hands, "Your Highness, please forgive me—no one is allowed to leave the women's quarters tonight."

The crown prince said, "Sitaram, then will you also take up arms against me?
Alright then, come."
Saying this, he drew his sword.

With folded hands, Sitaram said, "No, Your Highness, I cannot raise arms against you—you have saved my life twice."
Saying this, he took the dust of his feet and put it on his head.

The crown prince said, "Then what do you want to do, do it quickly—there is no more time."

Sitaram said, "You have saved my life twice, please don't destroy it this time.
Disarm me.
This loona is my weapon.
Tie me up completely.
Otherwise, I won't be safe from the king tomorrow."

The prince took his weapon and tied him up with his clothes.
He left him lying there and went away.
After going some distance, he saw a very high wall-like structure.
There was only one gate in that wall, and that gate was also closed.
Once you cross that gate, you can go directly outside the women's quarters.
The prince, instead of knocking on the gate, jumped right over the wall.
He saw a guard leaning against the wall and sleeping soundly.
He climbed down very carefully.
He fell on the sleeping guard like a thunderbolt.
He snatched his weapon and threw it away, and tied up the bewildered and overwhelmed guard from head to toe.
He had the key with him, so he took the key and opened the door.
Then the guard regained consciousness and said in astonishment, "Your Highness, what are you doing?"

The crown prince said, "I am opening the door of the women's quarters."

The guard said, "What answer shall I give to the Maharaj tomorrow?"

Udayaditya said, "Tell me, the crown prince has forcefully defeated us and opened the door of the women's quarters.
Then you will be free."

Udayaditya came out of the women's quarters and went to the room where his son-in-law's people were staying.
Only Rammohan and the jester Ramai were sleeping in that room, and the rest had gone to the boat after eating.
The prince gently touched Rammohan.
He woke up with a start.
Surprised, he said, "Is it you, Your Highness?"
The prince said, "Come outside."
Rammohan came out.
The prince told Rammohan everything.

Then Rammohan tied a sheet around his head and picked up a stick.
Swelling with anger, he said, "Let's see how great a man Lachhman Sardar is.
Crown prince, just bring our Maharaj to me once.
I can chase away a hundred men with just this stick!"

The crown prince said, "I agree with you, but there are many more than a hundred people in Jashore's royal palace!
You won't be able to do anything by force.
We have to find another way."

Rammohan said, "Alright, bring the Maharaj to me once, if he stands beside me, I can think of a way with peace of mind."
Then Udayaditya went inside the women's quarters and called Ramchandra.
He came along with everyone else.

Ramchandra, seeing Rammohan, became overwhelmed with anger and said, "I am firing you right now—get out of my sight!
You are an old man, what more punishment can I give you—if I survive this, I will never see your face again."
As he spoke, Ramchandra's voice choked up.
He truly loved Rammohan, who had been taking care of him since he was a child.

Rammohan folded his hands and said, "Who are you, Maharaj, to relieve me?
God has given me this job.
The day I receive the summons of Yama, that day God will relieve me of this job.
Whether you keep me or not, I am your servant."
Saying this, he stood in front of Ramchandra.

Udayaditya said, "Rammohan, what should I do?"
Rammohan said, "With your blessings, this stick is the solution.
And I rely on the feet of Mother Kali."

Udayaditya shook his head and said, "That method is of no use.
Well, Rammohan, in which direction is your boat?"

Rammohan said, "In the canal on the south side of the palace."

Udayaditya said, "Let's go to the roof for a while."

Suddenly an idea popped into Rammohan's head—he said, "Yes, that's right, let's go there."

Everyone went up to the roof of the palace.
The canal was about 70 cubits below the roof.
Ramchandra's boat with sixty-four oars was floating in that canal.
Rammohan said, he would tie Ramchandra Ray on his back and jump down there.

Basanta Ray hurriedly caught hold of Rammohan and exclaimed, "No, no, no, how can that be?
Rammohan, don't do such an impossible thing."

Bibha exclaimed in surprise and fear, "No, Mohan, what are you saying?"
Ram Chandra said, "No, Ram Mohan, that will not happen."

Then Udayaditya went inside the palace and brought a few very thick and large sheets.
Rammohan tied them together and made them into a huge rope-like structure.
He tied the rope to a small pillar on the roof on the side where the boat was.
The rope ended slightly above the boat.
Rammohan said to Ramchandra Ray, "Your Highness, you hold onto my back
and I will climb down the rope."
Ramchandra reluctantly agreed.
Then Rammohan bowed down to everyone one by one and touched their feet, saying, "Victory to Mother Kali."
He lifted Ramchandra onto his back, and Ramchandra closed his eyes and held on to his back for dear life.
Rammohan looked towards Bibha and said, "Mother, I am leaving now.
Do not fear as long as your son is alive!"

Rammohan grabbed the rope.
Bibha stood leaning against the pillar with all her might.
Old Basanta Ray stood with trembling feet, closed his eyes and started chanting "Durga", "Durga".
Rammohan climbed down holding the rope and reached the end of it.
Then he let go of his hands, bit the rope with his teeth, untied Ramchandra from his back, hung him with both hands and very carefully lowered him into the boat, and jumped in himself.
As soon as Ramchandra got into the boat, he fainted.
As soon as Ramchandra got into the boat, Bibha let out a deep and long breath and fainted.
Basanta Ray opened his eyes and asked, "Dada, what happened?"
Udayaditya took the unconscious Bibha in his arms affectionately and went inside the palace.
Surma held Udayaditya's hand and said, "What will happen to you now?"
Udayaditya said, "I don't care about myself."

Meanwhile, the boat got stuck a little further away.
The canal was blocked with large sal logs!
At that moment, the guards suddenly saw from a distance that the boat was escaping.
They started throwing stones, but none of them reached the boat.
The guards had swords in their hands, not guns.
One of them went to get a gun.
After searching, he found a gun, but he couldn't find the flint — while he was searching for gunpowder and bullets, Rammohan and his followers pulled the boat over the logs and took it away.
The guards went to call for a boat to follow them.
The one who was tasked with calling for the boat stopped at Harimudi's shop on the way, smoked a pipe of tobacco, and woke up Ramshankar from his bed to collect his outstanding dues.
When the need for the boat was completely gone, the boat arrived after much shouting.
Seeing the delay, everyone started scolding the boat caller.
He said, "I am not a horse!"
After everyone had finished scolding him one by one, they realized that there was no chance of catching the boat.
It took three times longer to scold him for the delay in bringing the boat.
When Ramchandra's boat reached the Bhairab River, Fernandez fired a cannon.
Pratapaditya had been woken up at dawn.
He suddenly woke up from his sleep at the sound of the cannon.
He called out, "Guard!"
No one came.
The guards at the door had already fled that night.
Pratapaditya called out in a louder voice, "Guard!"

## Chapter 12

Pratapaditya woke up and called out loudly, "Guard!"
When the guard did not come, he immediately got out of bed and rushed out of the room like lightning.
He called out, "Minister!"
A servant ran and immediately called the minister to the inner apartment.

"Minister, where did the guards go?"

The minister said - "The guards at the outer gate have fled."
The minister saw that danger was looming over his head.
For this reason, he gave a clear, concise, and quick answer to Pratap Aditya's words.
The more he tried to beat around the bush and delay his response, the more Pratap Aditya would flare up.

Pratapaditya said, "The guards of the women's quarters?"

The minister said, "When I came, I saw that their hands and feet were tied."
The minister did not know anything about the night's events!
He could not guess what had happened, yet he understood that something terrible had happened.
At that time, it was impossible to ask the Maharaja anything.

Pratapaditya said hurriedly, "Where is Ramchandra Ray?
Where is Udayaditya?
Where is Basanta Ray?"

The minister said slowly, "I think they are in the women's quarters!"

Pratapaditya said in annoyance, "I think I could do that too!
I asked you what to do!
What is thought of is not always true!"

The minister left silently without saying anything.
Ramapati came to know about the night's incident in its entirety.
When he heard that Ramchandra Ray had escaped, he became particularly worried.
The minister went outside and saw the short-statured buffoon Ramai sitting there rolling around.
Seeing the minister, the buffoon Ramai said, "Oh, here comes the minister Jambavan!" and bared his teeth.
The courtiers of Ramchandra used to call his toothy grin humor, not horror!
The minister did not say anything in response to his cordial greeting, nor did he even look at him.
He told a servant, "Bring him here!"
The minister thought, let me put this good-for-nothing in front of Pratapaditya's wrath right now.
Pratapaditya's thunderbolt will fall on someone or the other—let it fall on this banana tree, so that the other big trees are saved!

Upon seeing Ramai, Pratapaditya flared up— especially when he tried to please Pratapaditya by showing his teeth, gesturing, and attempting to say something funny.
At that moment, Pratapaditya could not tolerate it anymore.
He immediately got up from his seat, waved his hands, and said with great disgust, "Take him away, take him away!
Get him out of my sight right now!
Who told you to bring him in front of me?"
If Pratapaditya's anger had not been accompanied by disgust, the jester Ramai would not have been spared this time!
Because even when striking a despicable person, one has to touch them.
Ramai was immediately thrown out.

The minister said, "Your Majesty, the Queen Mother,"

Pratapaditya shook his head impatiently and said, "Ramchandra Ray-"

The minister said, "Yes, he left the palace last night."

Pratapaditya stood up and said, "Abandoned and left!
Where did the guards go?"

The minister said again, "The guards at the outer gate have fled."

Pratapaditya clenched his fists and said, "Escaped?
Where will they escape to?
We have to find out where they are and bring them back!
Call the guards of the women's quarters immediately!"
The minister left.

When Ramchandra Ray got on the boat, it was still dark.
Udayaditya, Basanta Ray, Surma, and Bibha did not go to bed that night.
Bibha laid down exhausted without saying a word or shedding a tear.
Surma sat beside her and stroked her head.
Udayaditya and Basanta Ray sat in silence.
In the darkness, they could vaguely see each other's faces.
It was as if someone invisible—call it darkness, fear, or fate—was sitting in the room, and they could hear the sound of its breath.
Basanta Ray, who always had a cheerful heart, was deeply distressed by the joylessness all around him.
He kept stroking his beard, looking around, and thinking—what has happened!
He was confused and could not grasp the situation properly.
The whole incident seemed like a complicated nightmare to him.
Every now and then, Basanta Ray would hold Udayaditya's hand and say in a plaintive voice, "Dada!"
Udayaditya would say, "What is it, Dadamhashay?"
Basanta Ray would not say anything more in response.
In that single word "Dada," a distressed and disoriented heart struggled to express a thousand unspoken questions.
He did not have any specific question; all he wanted to say was—what is this?
The darkness around him was making such a commotion, speaking to him in a language he could not understand.
Only when Udayaditya responded, did his mind calm down a little.
Every now and then, he would hold Udayaditya's hand and say sorrowfully, "Dada, did all this happen because of me?"
He kept thinking that all this had happened because he could not destroy him.
Udayaditya was in no mood to talk much at that moment.
He said in a gentle voice, "No, Dadamhashay!"
The room was silent for a long time.
After a while, Basanta Ray spoke again, "Bibha, my sister, why aren't you saying anything?"
Saying this, Basanta Ray went and sat down next to Bibha.
After a while, Basanta Ray said again, "Surma, oh Surma!"
Surma looked up but did not say anything.
The old man sat there, stroking his beard.
He waited for an unspecified danger.
Surma was sitting still, stroking Bibha's forehead, but only the all-knowing could see what was going on in Surma's heart.
In the darkness, Surma looked at Udayaditya's face once.
Udayaditya was leaning against the wall, lost in thought.
Tears welled up in Surma's eyes.
She wiped them away quietly, lest Bibha notice.

When it was almost dawn, Basanta Ray heaved a sigh of relief.
Then an undefined fear left his mind.
Then he thought over the whole incident calmly.
He got up from Bibha's room.
He went to the inner apartment's door where the tied up Sitaram was and said, "Listen Sitaram, when Pratap asks you who tied you up, you will take my name.
Pratap knows that Basanta Ray was once very strong, he will believe you."

Sitaram was thinking about how he would respond to Pratapaditya for so long.
He was reluctant to mention Udayaditya's name in this regard.
He had once decided to accuse a crooked-legged, three-eyed, palm tree-shaped ghost, but after meeting Basanta Ray, he let the innocent ghost go.
He immediately agreed with Basanta Ray.
Then he went to the second guard and said, "Bhagavat, if Pratap asks, tell him that Basanta Ray tied you up."
Suddenly, Bhagavat's religious consciousness became very strong, and he developed a deep aversion to falsehood; the main reason for this was that he had become very angry with Udayaditya.

Bhagavat said, "Do not order me to do such a thing, it will be a sin for me."

Basanta put his hand on his shoulder and said, "Bhagavat, listen to me; there is no sin in this.
If there is any sin in lying to save the life of a good man, then why would I ask you to do such a thing?"
Basanta Ray put his hand on his shoulder and back and tried to convince him again and again that there was no sin in this.
But when a person's sense of religion suddenly becomes very strong, no amount of reasoning works on him.
He said, "No, Maharaj, how can I lie to my master!"

Basanta Ray became very restless; he said anxiously, "Bhagabat, listen to me, I will explain to you, there is no sin in this lie.
Look, my boy, I will make you very happy later, you keep your word.
Here, take whatever I have, here you go."

Bhagabat immediately stretched out his hand, and in a moment, those coins took shelter in his pocket.
Basanta Ray felt somewhat relieved and returned.

Pratapaditya heard the guards calling out.
The minister took them along with him.
Pratapaditya was sitting there, suppressing his anger and in a calm and composed manner.
He spoke slowly and clearly, pronouncing each word distinctly, "How did the door of the women's quarters open last night?"

Sitaram's heart started to tremble, he said with folded hands, "I beg you, Your Majesty, I am not at fault."

The king furrowed his brows and said, "Who is asking you that?"

Sitaram said hurriedly, "No, your majesty, the crown prince—the crown prince forcibly tied me up and took me out of the women's quarters."
The name of the crown prince came out of his mouth suddenly.
He had thought a lot about not saying that name, which is why that name came to his mind first in the confusion.
Once it came out, there was no going back.

At that moment Basanta Ray heard the guards calling out.
He hurriedly went to Pratapaditya's room and presented himself.
At that time Sitaram was saying, "I forbade the prince, but he did not listen."

Basanta Ray quickly said, "Yes, yes, Sitaram, what did you say?
Don't do any injustice, Sitaram, God will be pleased with you.
Udayaditya is not at fault in this."

Sitaram quickly said, "No, your highness, the prince is not at fault."

Pratapaditya said in a firm voice, "Then whose fault is it?"

Sitaram said, "No, sir."

"Then whose fault is it?"

"Yes, Your Highness—"

When Bhagavat was questioned, he told everything correctly, except he hid the fact that he had fallen asleep.
Old Basanta Ray thought about it from all angles but couldn't find a solution.
He closed his eyes and prayed to Goddess Durga in his mind.
The two guards were immediately dismissed from their duties.
Their crime was that if they could be tied up so easily, what was the point of them being guards?
For this crime, they were sentenced to be whipped.

Then Pratapaditya looked at Basanta Ray's face and said in a thunderous voice, "Udayaditya's crime is unforgivable."
He said it in such a way that it seemed as if Udayaditya's crime was Basanta Ray's.
As if he was reprimanding Udayaditya in front of him.
Basanta Ray's crime was that he loved Udayaditya more than his own life.

Basanta Ray quickly said, "Baba Pratap, Uday is not at fault in this."

Pratapaditya said angrily, "No fault?
You say no fault, that's why I will punish him severely!
Why did you come in between to mediate?"

Because Basanta Ray had taken Udayaditya's side, Pratapaditya's mind became especially opposed to Udayaditya.
Basanta Ray saw that in order to punish him, Udayaditya might be punished.
He sat silently and began to think.

After a while, Pratapaditya said calmly, "If I knew that Udayaditya had some willpower of his own, that he had an opinion, an intention, that he did everything on his own, if I didn't know that he was such a fool that anyone could blow him away or turn him around with a sarcastic remark, then he wouldn't have been spared today.
When I saw that feather flying, I looked down to see who was blowing it!
That's why I don't feel like punishing Udayaditya.
He doesn't deserve to be punished either.
But listen, paternal uncle, if you come to Jashore again and meet Udayaditya, it will be your responsibility to save his life."

Basanta Ray remained silent for a long time; then he slowly got up and said — "Alright Pratap, I'll leave this afternoon."
Without another word, Basanta Ray walked out of the house and took a deep breath.

Pratapaditya has decided that whoever loves Udayaditya, whoever Udayaditya is fond of, they must be separated from Udayaditya.
He told the minister, "Bouma will not be allowed to stay in the palace anymore, somehow she must be sent to her father's house."
Pratapaditya had no suspicion about Bibha; after all, she is the daughter of the house!

## Chapter 13

Basanta Ray came to Udayaditya's room and said, "Brother, I won't be able to see you again."
Saying this, the old man held Udayaditya tightly with both hands.

Udayaditya held Basanta Ray's hand and said, "Why, granduncle?"

Basanta Ray told everything.
He said while crying, "Brother, I love you that's why you are in so much pain.
But if you are happy, then I will somehow manage to survive."

Udayaditya shook his head and said, "No, that will never happen.
We will meet for sure.
No one can stop us.
If you go, granduncle, I will not be able to live anymore."

Basanta Ray said anxiously, "Pratap did not kill me, he snatched you away from me.
Brother, when I leave, don't look back at me, just think that Basanta Ray is dead!"

Udayaditya went near Surma in the bedroom.
Basanta Ray went near Bibha, held her chin and said, "Sister Bibha, please get up!
Run your hand over this old man's head once."
Bibha got up and sat down, took her grandfather's head and started combing his gray hair.

Udayaditya told Surma everything and said, "Surma, it seems like there is a conspiracy going on to snatch away everything that I have left in this world."
Holding Surma's hand, he said, "Surma, what if someone takes you away from me?"

Surma firmly embraced Udayaditya and said in a determined voice, "If Yama, the god of death, can do it, then no one else can."

The same fear had been growing in Surma's mind for a long time.
She seemed to see a cruel hand reaching out to take Udayaditya away from her.
In her mind, she held Udayaditya tightly in her arms and said to herself, "I will not let go, no one can make me let go."

Surma said again, "I have been thinking for a long time that no one will be able to take me away from you."

Surma repeated those words again and again.
She wants to gather strength in her mind, with which she will embrace Udayaditya with both her arms in such a way that no worldly power will be able to separate them.
By repeating those words again and again, she is binding her mind with the strength of a thunderbolt.

Udayaditya looked at Surma's face and sighed, saying, "Surma, I won't be able to see granduncle again!"

Surma sighed.

Udayaditya said, "I am not worried about my own suffering, Surma,—but I am very worried about my granduncle.
Let's see what else the Creator does.
What else does he want!"

Udayaditya told many stories of Basanta Ray.

Basanta Ray's words and deeds started coming back to his mind.
Basanta Ray's compassionate heart, his numerous small acts of kindness, his countless little words, all these were stored in his memory like tiny jewels, and now he started sharing them one by one with Surma.

Surma said, "Ah, is there anyone like granduncle?"

Surma and Udayaditya went to Bibha's room.

At that time Bibha is combing her grandfather's gray hair, and he is sitting and singing a song;—

"Oh, we have to go, no more delay,

How far behind Ravi has fallen, your companions have all gone.

Oh, having finished the play of life, you have come, darkening everything,

(Hey) Why do you keep looking back again and again, brother?

Came to play in the drama of life, new people, new play,

Get out of here, or else I'll hit you with a stone.

Having unloaded the burden of life, let's go straight to another country,

(There) you will build a new house, you will play new games in that place.

Seeing Udayaditya, Basanta Ray laughed and said, "Look brother, Bibha doesn't want to leave me.
I don't know what she needs from me!
Once there was milk, now that I have grown old, it has turned into buttermilk, so why does Bibha want to satisfy her craving for milk with buttermilk?
Bibha cries when she hears that I am leaving!
Have you ever heard of anything like this?
Brother, I can't bear to see Bibha cry."
Saying this, he started to sing,

"It is time for me to go,

Why are you holding me back,

With the dam of tears

I will not tie you with the strings of affection anymore.

The vacation of life is over;

Take back your two eyes,

You don't call me by my name anymore, brother,

"We have to go quickly!"

"Look there, look there, see Bibha's antics!
Look Bibha, if you cry like that then-" Basanta Ray couldn't finish his sentence.
He couldn't control himself while scolding Bibha, he quickly wiped away his tears and said with a smile, "Dada, look there, sister Surma is crying!
Take care of her right now; otherwise, I will really stay here; I will occupy your place.
I will tie up her long hair with both hands, I will whisper from the side of her broken teeth near her ears, and if any mishap happens because of going too close to her ears, then I won't be responsible!"

Basanta Ray noticed that no one said anything, so he became anxious and picked up his tambura and started to play it very fast with a jangling noise.
However, seeing Bibha's tears, it became very difficult for him to play the tambura, his eyes started to blur from time to time, and he felt like insulting Bibha and everyone present, but he could not say anything, his throat choked up, and he had to stop and put away the tambura.
Finally, the time for farewell came.

After embracing Udayaditya for a long time, she said these last words, "I am leaving this sitar with you, brother, I will not play the sitar anymore.
May you live happily, brother Surma; Bibha—" She could not finish her sentence, she wiped her tears and got into the palanquin.

## Chapter 14

Mangala's hut was at one end of Jessore.
She was sitting there and chanting the rosary.
At that moment, Matangini, a maidservant of the royal palace, arrived with a basket of vegetables in her hand.

Matanga said, "I came to the market today and suddenly thought that I haven't seen elder sister Mangala for a long time, so let me go and see her.
I have a lot of work today, I won't be able to stay for long."
Saying this, he sat down there comfortably, leaning against a pillar.
"Well, sister, you know everything, that meanie used to love me a lot, maybe she still does, but I have realized that her heart now belongs to someone else—so can't that witch kill him within three nights?"

Mangala has remedies for all kinds of misfortunes, from losing a cow to losing a husband.
Apart from that, she knows such methods of captivating people that the big servants of the royal palace roll around in heaps at Mangala's hut!
The sorceress who can save Matangini if she dies within three nights is none other than Mangala herself!

Mangala thought to herself with a smile, "That witch is in no hurry to die, she will only die after increasing Yama's work."
Mangala said openly with a smile, "Is there such an insensitive person who would leave a beauty like you and set his heart elsewhere?
Don't worry, my granddaughter.
You will win his heart back.
You have the cure in your eyes, try using it a little more, and if that doesn't work, then feed him this root with betel leaf."
Saying this, she brought a dried root.

Mangala asked Matangini, "Tell me, what is the news from the palace?"

Matangini turned her hand over and said, "What do we have to do with all that talk, brother?"

Mangala said, "That's right.
That's right."

Matangini had not expected that Mangala would suddenly agree with her on this matter.
She puffed up a little and said, "Well, I don't mind telling you, but I don't have much time today; I'll tell you everything another day."
Saying this, she sat down.

Mangala said - "That's great, we'll hear it some other day."

Matangini became impatient and said, "Then I'll go, brother.
If I delay any further, I'll get another scolding.
Listen, brother, that day, the king's son-in-law came to our place, and the very night he arrived, he left without telling anyone."

Mangala said, "Really?
Of course; tell me why; that's why I say that no one can give me inside news except Matanga."

Matanga said cheerfully, "Do you know what the real thing is?
Our Bou-Thakurani, she can't see anyone with her two eyes.
Does she know some magic, she has kept her husband like a sheep, he—no brother; it's useless, who will listen to you and who will say that Matanga goes around telling the stories of the royal palace outside."

Mangala could not control her curiosity any longer; although she knew that if she remained silent for a while longer, Matanga would tell her everything himself, she could not bear the delay and said, "There is no one here, granddaughter.
And what is the harm in talking between ourselves?
So what did your Bou-Thakurani do?"

"She had put in a good word for her sister-in-law with her son-in-law, and so he left her sister-in-law overnight.
Now, the sister-in-law is crying and lamenting.
The Maharaja is furious and wants to send Bou-Thakurani back to her father's house in Shreepur.
Look brother, you laugh at everything!
What's so funny about this?
You can't even control your laughter."

Every servant of the palace knew the real reason behind Ramchandra Roy's escape, but no one discussed it with anyone else.

Mangala said, "Tell your mother-in-law that there is no need to send Bou-Thakurani back to her father's house so soon.
Mangala can give her such a medicine that the prince's mind will completely turn away from her."
Saying this, she started laughing loudly.
Matanga said, "That's a good idea!"

Mangala asked, "Does the Crown Prince love your Bou-Thakurani very much?"

"What's the use of talking about it!
Can't stay even for a moment without seeing him!
Just call the prince 'you' and he'll come."

"Alright, I will give medicine.
Does the prince stay with her during the day as well?"

"Yes."

Mangala said, "Oh, what will happen!
So, what did you see the prince say and do?"

"No brother, I haven't seen that."

"Can you take me to the palace once, so that I can see it once!"

Matanga said, "Why brother, why do you have such a headache?"

Mangala said, "Oh no!
I'll understand what spell she has cast on him once I see him.
Let's see if my spell works!"

Matanga said, "That's great, I'll come today then!"
Saying this, he picked up his fishing rod and left.

When Matanga left, Mangala started to cry, gritting her teeth, widening her eyes, and muttering.

## Chapter 15

Basanta Ray left.
By then, it is already evening.
Bibha went to the roof of the palace.
From the roof, she saw the palanquin leaving.
Basanta Ray peeped out of the palanquin and looked back once.
In the darkness of the evening, amidst the tears, he could see the unchanging, unwavering, heartless, long, rigid walls of the palace hazy and dim.
The palanquin left, but Bibha stood there.
She kept looking at the path.
The stars appeared, the lamps were lighted, and the road was deserted.
Bibha stood there, silently watching.
Surma looked for all over the place for her and finally found her on the roof.
She hugged Bibha and said in an affectionate voice, "What are you looking at, Bibha?"
Bibha sighed and said, "Who knows, brother!"
Bibha sees emptiness all around, there is no happiness in her life.
She doesn't know why she goes inside the room, why she comes out of the room, why she goes to sleep, why she gets up, why she wanders around the house from room to room in the afternoon.
She feels like her home is gone from the palace, as she has no room in the palace anymore.
From her childhood, amidst various games, joys, sorrows, laughter, and tears, a palace had been built up for her, but who destroyed it in overnight?
This room is no longer her room!
She is now homeless within a home.
Her granduncle was there, but he is gone.
When will people come from Chandradwip to take Bibha away?
Perhaps Rammohan Mal has already left, and by now, who knows where they are!
Bibha still has some happiness left.
She still has a good brother and her dear Surma still.
But it seems like a dangerous shadow is looming over their relationship too.
Can you still call it "home" when a thick, dark, and mysterious secret is permeating the very foundation of the house?

Udayaditya heard that after being dismissed from service, Sitaram had fallen on hard times.
On the one hand, he did not have a penny to his name, and on the other hand, he was plagued by a number of misfortunes.
Because when he used to get a fat salary from the royal palace, his wife, suddenly overcome with excessive affection, had given up all her work and become distraught with grief at the separation from the object of her affection; and after making elaborate arrangements for their reunion, she had been overjoyed and had declared that just seeing Sitaram had satisfied her hunger and thirst.
There is plenty of evidence that hunger and thirst can be satisfied, but there is no evidence that it could be done just by seeing Sitaram.
A distant widowed cousin of Sitaram was trying to find some work for her son, when it suddenly occurred to her that it would be an insult to her nephew to put him in a lowly job, and so, in order to protect her nephew's honor, she somehow could not bring herself to do that work.
In this way, she protected his honor, indebted Sitaram to her, and in return, made arrangements for her own livelihood.
In addition to this, Sitaram had a widowed mother and an unmarried young daughter.
On the other hand, Sitaram was a very pleasure-loving man, and he could not do without his amusements.
Sitaram's circumstances had changed, but his lifestyle had not changed at all.
His wife's hunger and thirst remained exactly the same; and as his niece grew older, her appetite and her concern for her uncle's honor and humiliation grew in equal measure.
No one except Sitaram's money bag showed any sign of shrinking.
Along with Sitaram's other misfortunes, his debts also remained, and they were increasing on account of interest; and the interest was also increasing at the same rate.
On hearing about Sitaram's poverty, Udayaditya fixed a monthly stipend for him and Bhagavat.
Sitaram was very ashamed on receiving the money.
By taking Udayaditya's name before the Maharaja, he had committed a grave offense against himself and Udayaditya.
On receiving Udayaditya's money, he burst into tears.
One day, he met the Crown Prince, fell at his feet, and repeatedly begged his forgiveness, addressing him as God, the Lord of the Universe, and the Merciful One.
Bhagavat was a very cool-headed person!
He played chess, smoked tobacco, and distributed plots of land in heaven and hell to his neighbors.
When he received Udayaditya's money, he made a wry face and, with various gestures, conveyed that the Crown Prince had ruined him, and how could this money compensate for that!
He had no objection to taking the money, though.

Pratapaditya came to know that the crown prince was giving monthly stipends to the two dismissed guards.
Earlier, this would not have happened.
Earlier, he used to neglect Udayaditya so much that he did not get to hear everything about Udayaditya.
The king knew that Udayaditya mingled with the subjects and sometimes acted against him by supporting the subjects, but those were so petty and so insignificant that he had been tolerating them and Udayaditya's existence did not draw his attention unless something major happened.
This time, he paid a little more attention to Udayaditya and that is why the above-mentioned incident immediately reached his ears.
Hearing this, Pratapaditya became very angry.
He sent for Udayaditya and said, "I dismissed Sitaram and Bhagwat, was it only because the royal treasury did not have enough money to pay their salaries?
Then why have you fixed their monthly stipends from your own pocket?"

Udayaditya said slowly, "I am guilty.
You have punished me by punishing them.
According to your judgment, I have been punishing them every month."

Pratapaditya had never listened to Udayaditya so attentively before.
Udayaditya's slow, serious, and humble tone and his well-organized words did not displease Pratapaditya at all.
Without responding to Udayaditya's words, Pratapaditya said, "I am ordering you, Uday, that they should not be given any more financial assistance in the future."

Udayaditya said, "A more severe punishment has been ordered for me."
But with folded hands he said, "But what crime have I committed that I should have to bear such a big punishment?
How can I see that eight or nine hungry mouths are not getting food because of me, eight or nine unfortunate people are crying on the streets because they are homeless; yet there is no shortage of food on my plate?
Father, whatever I have is only by your grace.
You give me more food than I need on my plate, but if you make eight or nine hungry and helpless people sit in front of me during my meal and forbid me from putting food in their mouths, then that food is poison to me!"

Pratapaditya did not interrupt the agitated Udayaditya while he was speaking.
After he had finished, Pratapaditya said slowly, "I have heard what you have to say.
Now I will say what I have to say.
I have stopped the stipends of Bhagavat and Sitaram.
If anyone else fixes a stipend for them, he will be considered to have acted against my wishes."
A special kind of anger had arisen in Pratapaditya's mind.
Perhaps he himself did not understand the reason for it, but the reason was this: "As if I have committed a great cruelty, so the embodiment of kindness, Udayaditya, has come to prevent it.
Let's see what he can do with his kindness!
Where I am cruel, if anyone else is kind, who can tolerate such audacity?"

Udayaditya went to Surma and told her everything.
Surma said, "They didn't get anything to eat the whole day that day, in the evening, Sita Ram's mother came to me with Sita Ram's little daughter and started crying.
I gave them something that evening, then their whole family got to eat.
Sita Ram's daughter is a baby, she didn't eat anything the whole day, how can I look at her face.
If we don't give them something, where will they go?"

Udayaditya said, "Especially, when they have been driven out of the palace, then out of fear of father, no one else will dare to give them work or help them, if we also turn away at this time, then they will have no one left in the world.
I will definitely help, don't worry about that Surma, but it is not good to displease father unnecessarily, we have to find a way to resolve this matter secretly."

Surma held Udayaditya's hand and said, "You don't have to do anything else, I will do everything, put your trust in me."
Surma wants to protect Udayaditya with herself.
This year has been a difficult one for Udayaditya.
Fate is pushing him towards actions that are against his father; and yet these are such actions that a devoted wife like Surma cannot stop her husband from doing.
Surma is not that kind of wife; when her husband goes to a holy war, Surma ties his armor with her own hands, and then goes inside and cries.
Surma's heart is filled with fear at every step, yet she reassures Udayaditya at every step.
In times of great danger, Udayaditya has looked at Surma's face and seen tears in her eyes, but Surma's hands do not tremble, Surma's steps do not falter.

Surma, through one of her trusted maidservants, arranged to send an allowance to Sita Ram's mother and Bhagavat's wife.
The maidservant was trustworthy, but she did not consider it necessary to keep the matter a secret from Mangala.
Therefore, no one outside of Mangala was aware of it.

## Chapter 16

When Pratapaditya heard about the secret scholarship, he sent a message to the inner palace without saying a word, ordering Surma to go to her father's house.
Udayaditya clenched his fists tightly.
Bibha started crying and hugged Surma, saying, "If you go, what will I do in this graveyard?"
Surma held Bibha's chin, kissed her on the cheek, and said, "Why would I go, Bibha?
My whole world is here."
When Surma heard Pratapaditya's order, she said, "I see no reason to go to my father's house.
No one has come from there to take me, and my husband also does not agree with this.
Therefore, I see no reason to suddenly go to my father's house without any reason."
Hearing this, Pratapaditya was furious.
But he realized that there was no way.
Surma could not be forced out of the house, physical force could not be used in the inner palace.
Pratapaditya was completely inexperienced when it came to women.
He knew how to use force against force, but he had no idea how to deal with these helpless women.
He could tear large pieces of cloth, but he could not untie the delicate knots of thin threads with his thick fingers.
In his opinion, these women were completely invincible and incomprehensible creatures.
Whenever there was any trouble regarding them, he would quickly pass the responsibility to his queen.
He had neither the time, nor the desire, nor the ability to think about them.
This was a completely unsuitable task for him.
This time too, Pratapaditya called his queen and said, "Send Surma to her father's house!"
The queen said, "Then what will happen to Uday?"
Pratapaditya said in annoyance, "Uday is not a child anymore.
I want to send Surma away from the palace because of the state affairs.
This is my order."

The queen called Udayaditya and said, "Baba Uday, let's send Surma to her father's house!"
Udayaditya said, "Why mother, what wrong has Surma done?"

The queen said, "Who knows, my child, we are women, we don't understand anything, only the Maharaj knows what opportunities will arise in his royal duties by sending the queen to her father's house."

Udayaditya said, "Mother, how has the state of affairs improved by giving me pain and making me unhappy?
I have endured as much pain as I could, what happiness is left for me?
It's not like Surma is very happy.
She has endured rebukes day and night, she has done away with her ornaments, and in the end, there was no place for her in the palace!
Doesn't she have any relation with you, mother?
Is she a beggar guest, who you will keep when you are happy and throw out when you are not?
If that is the case, mother, there is no place for me in the palace either, dismiss me as well."

The queen started crying and said, "Who knows, my child?
I can't understand what the Maharaja does sometimes.
But, I must say, our daughter-in-law is not a very good girl either.
Ever since she entered the palace, there has been no peace here.
It's become a living hell.
So, why don't we send her to her father's house for a few days and see what happens, my child?
If she stays away from here for a few days, we'll see if the peace of the house returns!"

Udayaditya did not reply to this, he sat silently for a while and then got up and left.

The queen went to Pratapaditya crying and fell at his feet, saying, "Maharaj, save me!
If Surma is sent, Uday won't survive.
The calf is not at fault, that Surma, that witch has cast some spell on him."
Saying this, the queen cried and became distraught.

Pratapaditya said angrily, "If Surma doesn't go, I will imprison Udayaditya!"

The queen came from the king and went to Surma and said, "Wicked woman, what have you done to my son?
Give my son back to me!
Haven't you ruined him enough since he came here?
In the end—he is the son of a king—won't you rest until you have him in chains?"

Surma shuddered and said, "He will be shackled because of me?
What are you saying, Mother!
I am leaving right now!"

Surma went to Bibha and told her everything.
Bibha held her throat and said, "Bibha, now that I am leaving, I feel that I will never be able to come back here again."
Bibha started crying and hugged Surma.
Surma sat down right there.
From the distant end of the endless future, a thought came and started ringing in her mind, "It will never happen again!"
I will never be able to come back, it will never happen again, nothing will remain!
Such a vast emptiness of the future spread out in front of her, —a future where there is no face, no laughter, no affection, no union of eyes, heart, and soul, no exchange of happiness and sorrow, no love, no affection, no anything, not even a drop of it for a moment even if her heart breaks into pieces, what a terrible future!
Surma's heart started breaking, her head started spinning, her tears dried up!
As soon as Udayaditya arrived, Surma hugged his feet, pressed them to her chest, and burst into tears.
Surma had never cried like this before.
Her strong heart has broken into a hundred pieces today.
Udayaditya took Surma's head in his lap and asked, "What happened, Surma?" Surma looked at Udayaditya's face and what else could she say?
She just kept looking at his face and crying.
She said, "Will I not be able to see that face?
When the evening comes, you will come and sit in the balcony, and I won't be there?
You will light the lamp in the room, you will come and stand near the door, and I won't come running with a smile to hold your hand?
When you are here, where will I be?"
When Surma said "where," there was so much despair in it, there was a sense of separation from a distant land!
When only the eyes can meet, how far apart they are!
When even that is not possible, how much farther apart they are!
When there is a delay in receiving news, how much farther apart they are!
When even with a dying wish, you won't be able to see each other for a moment, then—then it would be better to die right now, hugging those two feet to the chest like this.

## Chapter 17

In the beginning of the story, Rukmini was mentioned, I think the readers haven't forgotten her.
This Mangala is that Rukmini.
She left Raigarh, changed her name and started living in the outskirts of Jashore.
There is nothing extraordinary about Rukmini.
Like ordinary, lowly women, she is sensual, jealous, and greedy for power.
She can laugh and cry at will, she can express or suppress her emotions as needed.
When she is angry, she is very fierce; it seems as if she will tear the object of her anger apart with her teeth and nails.
At that time, she doesn't say much, fire comes out of her eyes, and she trembles.
Anger boils in the cauldron of her heart like molten iron.
Jealousy hisses and swells like a snake in her mind, lashing its tail.
On the other hand, she observes various vows and performs various tantric rituals.
She understands the minds of the people she associates with very well.
When the prince ascends to the throne, she hopes to establish her throne over his heart and rule both his heart and the kingdom of Jashore together.
This hope keeps her awake day and night.
What can't she do for this!
For many days, she has been trying relentlessly to befriend all the servants of the palace.
She keeps track of every little news of the palace.
She even hears when Surma's face turns pale, and even if Pratapaditya has a minor ailment, she hears about it and thinks that this time he will surely die.
She has performed various rituals for the death of Pratapaditya and Surma, but nothing has worked yet.
Every morning she wakes up thinking that today she will hear that Pratapaditya or Surma is lying dead in bed.
Her impatience grows every day.
She thinks, let the mantras and tantras go to hell, if I can just get my hands on them once, I will satisfy my heart's desire.
Thinking about it, she bites her lips so hard that they start to bleed.

Rukmini saw that the king and queen's indifference towards Surma was increasing day by day.
Finally, it went so far that a proposal was made to dismiss Surma from the palace.
She knew no bounds of joy.
When she saw that Surma still didn't leave, she resorted to an easy way to get rid of her.

When the queen heard that a widow named Mangala knew various kinds of tantra, mantra, and medicine, she thought that before sending Surma away from the palace, it would be better to win the crown prince's heart from her.
She secretly sent Matangini to bring medicine from Mangala.

Mangala spent the whole night cutting, soaking, mixing, and chanting mantras over various roots to prepare the poison.

In that silent, deep night, in the secluded outskirts of the city, the sound of the pestle and mortar began to rise in a hidden hut, that sound became his only companion, that incessant monotonous sound began to clap in rhythm with his dancing enthusiasm, his enthusiasm doubled and he started dancing, there was no more sleep in his eyes.

It took five days to prepare the medicine.
It does not take five days to prepare poison.
But Surma took a long time to recite mantras and perform rituals so that the prince would not feel pity for her at the time of her death.

Like Pratapaditya, the queen allowed Surma to stay in the palace for a few more days.
Surma is about to leave, Bibha is devastated.
She has been sitting beside Surma for the past few days.
Like a faint shadow, she silently follows Surma everywhere.
As each day passes and dusk falls, Bibha wants to hold Surma closer and tighter.
Someone seems to be pulling the days away from her desperate grasp.
Bibha is surrounded by darkness!
Surma's eyes are also empty.
She no longer has any sense of direction, the world around her has become a blur.
She lies at Udayaditya's feet, rests on his lap, stares silently at his face, and does nothing else.
She tells Bibha, "Bibha, I am leaving everything with you," and covers her face with both hands and bursts into tears.

Afternoon has arrived; tomorrow at dawn is Surma's day of departure.
She gradually handed over all her household items to Bibha.
Udayaditya sat calmly and determined.
He had decided that he would either keep Surma in the palace or he would also leave.
When evening fell, Surma could no longer stand, her legs began to tremble, and her head began to spin.
She went to the bedroom and lay down, saying, "Bibha, Bibha, call him here quickly.
There is no more time."

As Udayaditya came near the door, Surma exclaimed, "Come, come, my heart is aching!"
saying this, she stretched out both her arms.
As Udayaditya came closer, she clasped his feet.
Udayaditya sat down, then Surma breathed with great difficulty, her hands and feet became cold.
Udayaditya became frightened and called out, "Surma!"
Surma lifted her head very slowly and looked at Udayaditya's face and said, "What is it, my lord!"
Udayaditya said anxiously, "What happened Surma?"
Surma said, "I think my time has come," saying this, she tried to raise her hand to embrace Udayaditya's neck, but her hand did not rise!
She just kept looking at his face.
Udayaditya held Surma's face with both hands and said, "Surma, Surma, where will you go Surma!
Who else do I have?"
Tears started flowing from Surma's eyes.
She just looked at Bibha's face!
Bibha was then unconscious and was looking at Surma with vacant eyes.
In front of them was the balcony where Surma and Udayaditya used to sit every evening.
The stars in the sky are visible, the wind is blowing slowly, all around is still.
The lamp was lit in the room.
The conch shell and bell of the puja in the palace gradually stopped ringing.
Surma said to Udayaditya in a soft voice, "Say something, I can't see well."

Gradually, news spread in the palace that Surma had taken poison in her own hands and was dying.
The queen rushed in, everyone rushed in!
Seeing Surma's face, the queen started crying and said, "Surma, my dear, stay here, you don't have to go anywhere.
You are the goddess of our house, who told you to go?"
Surma took the dust of her mother-in-law's feet and put it on her head.
The queen cried doubly and said, "Mother, are you angry with me?"
By then Surma's throat was choked, she tried to say something, but it didn't come out.
When it was four hours into the night, the doctor said, "It's over!"
"Dada, what happened?"
Bibha fell on Surma's chest and hugged her tightly.
Dawn broke, Udayaditya sat with Surma's head in his lap!

## Chapter 18

Is Surma gone?
Why does Bibha not believe it at all?
As if she will see Surma, as if Surma is somewhere in that direction.
Bibha roams from room to room, her soul seems to be searching for Surma.
When it is time to tie her hair, she sits silently, as if Surma will come any moment, tie her hair, and she is waiting for her.
No, no, it is getting dark, it is getting night, Surma probably won't come anymore, her hair won't be tied.
Today Bibha's face has become so dull, Bibha is crying so much, yet why didn't Surma come, Surma never does this!
As soon as Bibha's face becomes a little dull, Surma comes to her, holds her throat, looks at her face with her life, and today—oh, she won't come even if her heart breaks.

Udayaditya's half of strength, half of life has gone away.
In every work, he had hope, enthusiasm, whose advice was his only support, whose smile was his only reward—she is gone!
He would go to his bedroom, as if to think something, would look around once, would see—no one!
Slowly he would come and sit in that balcony; the place where Surma used to sit, he would keep it empty, the same moonlight in the sky, the same forest in front, the wind was blowing in the same way—he would think, on such an evening, can't Surma come?

Suddenly, he felt as if he heard someone's voice like Surma's.
He would be startled and look around, even though he knew it was impossible.
He would go to the bed and check if there was anyone there.
Udayaditya, who used to be busy with hundreds of small tasks throughout the day, with poor subjects coming to him with gifts of fruits, roots, vegetables, and greens from their fields and gardens, and he would ask about their well-being and give them advice, can no longer do any of those things these days.
Yet, he still feels exhausted in the evening—he comes to his bedroom with weary steps, with a hope in his heart that as soon as he opens the door of his bedroom, he will see Surma sitting in the balcony.
When Udayaditya sees Bibha wandering around alone with a gloomy face, his heart aches.
He calls Bibha near him, caresses her, and says many affectionate things to her.
Finally, Bibha holds her brother's hand and bursts into tears, and Udayaditya's eyes also start to shed tears!
One day, Udayaditya called Bibha and said, "Bibha, who else do you have in this house?
Let me arrange to send you to your in-laws' house.
What do you say?
Don't be shy with me, Bibha!
Who else will you express your heart's desire to?"
Bibha remained silent.
She didn't say anything.
Does he even need to ask this question?
Does she have any desire to stay in her father's house?
Wouldn't her heart be restless to go to the only place in the world where she belongs—to Chandradwip?
But no one has even come to take her!
Why not?

Udayaditya once proposed to his father to send Bibha to her in-laws' house.
Pratapaditya said, "I have no objection to sending Bibha to her in-laws' house.
But if they had any affection for Bibha, they would have sent someone to take her on their own.
I don't see any need for us to be in such a hurry!"

Upon seeing the queen Bibha, she starts crying.
How can Bibha's widowhood be seen in her state as a married woman?
Her heart aches upon seeing Bibha's pitiful face.
Moreover, the queen loves her son-in-law very much, and she doesn't like the fact that the consequence of his childish behavior has gone so far.
She goes to the king and pleads with him, "Your Majesty, please send Bibha to her in-laws' house!"
The king gets angry and says, "I have heard this same thing many times, don't bother me anymore.
When they beg Bibha for alms, they will get her!"
The queen says, "What will people say if my daughter doesn't go to her in-laws' house for a long time?"
Pratapaditya says, "So what—if Pratapaditya himself goes and sends his daughter, and if Ramchandra Ray drives her away from his doorstep, then what will people say?"

The queen thought while crying that there is no way to know what the king will do at any given time.

## Chapter 19

Raja Ramchandra Ray had a very keen eye for respect and disrespect.
One day, the Raja was going out in his palanquin.
Two inexperienced weavers were sitting in front of their hut, weaving.
They did not stand up when they saw the palanquin.
The Raja made a big fuss about it.
Once in Jashore, he had ordered one of his father-in-law's servants to do some work.
The poor fellow misunderstood the order and did the work incorrectly.
The great Raja Ramchandra Ray concluded from this that his father-in-law's servants did not respect him.
He must have learnt this from his master, otherwise he would not have dared to do so.
Moreover, that very morning, he had seen the Crown Prince Udayaditya whispering something to the servant—obviously advising him to insult him.
What else could it be?
One day, some boys were playing at being king, ministers and courtiers, making a throne out of a mound of earth.
The Raja heard about it and severely reprimanded their fathers.

Today, the Maharaja is leaning against the bolster on his throne and smoking a hookah.
In front of him stands a timid, poor criminal whose trial is underway.
Somehow, this person got to hear about the incident related to Pratapaditya and Ramchandra Ray, and he discussed it with someone.
One of his enemies overheard this conversation and reported it to the king.
The king became furious and summoned the man.
Now, the king is deciding whether to hang him or banish him.
A big scene is being created.

The king is saying, "Son, you are so capable!"

She is crying and saying, "Oh Maharaj, I did not do such a thing!"

The minister says, "Son, how can you compare our Maharaj with Pratapaditya?"

The Dewan is saying, "Son, you don't know, when Pratapaditya's father first became the king, he appealed to our Maharaja's late paternal grandfather to get the royal insignia.
After much pleading and crying, he marked him with the royal insignia using the little finger of his left foot."

Ramai the bard says, "Vikramaditya's son Pratapaditya, they are kings for two generations!
Pratapaditya's grandfather was Kencho, Kencho's son was Jonko, the guy sucked the blood of his subjects and became extremely bloated, that Jonko's son has now scratched his head and made it bald and has learnt to wear a crown like a snake.
We have been bards in the royal court for generations, we are wise, don't we recognize a born snake?"
King Ramchandra Roy was very pleased today and started to chuckle with a smiling face.
Nowadays, Pratapaditya is attacked once in every court session.
After the warriors are satisfied by piercing Pratapaditya's back with sharp verbal arrows, the session is adjourned.
Anyway, in today's trial, the accused cried and pleaded a lot, so the mighty and glorious Ramchandra Roy said - "Alright, go - you are spared this time, be careful in the future!"

The other courtiers left, only the minister and the jester remained with the king.
The discussion about Pratapaditya continued.

Ramai said, "You just left, and here the prince got into a huge mess.
The king's intention was to sell the widow's gold bangles and anklets to add some money to the royal treasury.
The prince interfered with that.
How much commotion did that cause?"

The king started laughing and said, "Indeed!"

The minister said, "Your Majesty, I hear that Pratapaditya is full of regret these days.
He is thinking about how he will send his daughter to her in-laws' house and is losing his appetite and sleep."

The king said, "Really!" and started laughing, started smoking, felt very happy!

The minister said, "I said, don't send your daughter to her in-laws' house anymore!
The king has married in your house, and that has saved your seven generations.
After that, you haven't done such a great thing as bringing your daughter back home and disgracing your family!
What do you say, Thakur?"

Ramai said, "He has doubts.
Maharaj, you have stepped into the mud, it is the mud's father's luck, but that doesn't mean you won't wash your feet before entering the house, do you!"

In this way, the laughter and jokes continued.
Pratapaditya and Udayaditya's imaginary statues were placed in front of them and they started to be torn apart.
I cannot understand what Udayaditya's crime was.
The fact that he disregarded his own danger and saved Ramchandra Ray's life, all those things were forgotten, and, because he was Pratapaditya's son, Ramchandra Ray started to laugh and joke about him without any hesitation.
Ramchandra Ray is not cruel, he is a light-hearted, narrow-minded person.
He is not grateful to Udayaditya for saving his life.
He thinks, this is what should have happened, it would have been wrong if it hadn't.
When Ramchandra Ray was in danger, wouldn't everyone come together to save him!
He thinks, if Ramchandra Ray gets a thorn in his foot, the entire world feels the pain.
He cannot think that, to a very insignificant person in the world, the great king Ramchandra Ray is nothing in the face of his own danger.
Day and night, with hundreds of praise singers weighing the world on one side of the scale and himself on the other, he has convinced himself that he is heavier, which is why he does not easily feel grateful to anyone else.
Moreover, there is another reason why he does not feel grateful to Udayaditya: he thinks that Udayaditya saved him only for the sake of his sister, saving his life was not Udayaditya's intention.
Moreover, even if Ramchandra's heart had been filled with gratitude, he still would not have refrained from making fun of Udayaditya.
Because when ten people come together to make fun of someone, especially when the jester Ramai is making fun of someone, he does not have the strength of mind to shut their mouths or not join them.
He thinks, what would everyone think then.

Even now, Ramchandra Ray has a feeling of attachment towards Bibha, just like before.
Bibha is beautiful, Bibha has just stepped into her youth, Ramchandra Ray has met Bibha only for a very short time.
He has shown disregard towards Pratapaditya—but when he woke up from sleep for the first time that night and suddenly saw Bibha sitting on the bed and crying, the moonlight falling on her face, her half-covered chest heaving, tears flowing from her sweet, pitiful eyes, her small lips trembling like tender young leaves, then suddenly a kind of excitement arose in his mind; he took Bibha's head in his lap, wiped away the tears from her eyes, a desire arose in his heart to kiss her pitiful lips, then for the first time electricity coursed through his body for a moment, then for the first time he saw the beauty of Bibha's newly blossomed youth, then for the first time his faith flowed swiftly, a line of water appeared on his half-closed eyelids, his heart began to beat faster.
He went to kiss Bibha.
Just then there was a knock at the door, just then he heard news of danger.
That first blossoming of the heart, that first excitement of desire, that enchanting sight of the eyes, since it remained unfulfilled, it remained in Ramchandra Ray's memory, thirsty and restless.
This is not a feeling of lasting love, because it is not possible for Ramchandra Ray's frivolous heart.
Just as a connoisseur's heart is suddenly drawn to a luxury item, in the same way, Ramchandra Ray had developed a feeling for Bibha.
Whatever the reason, Bibha was awake in Ramchandra Ray's youthful dreams.
He had developed a desire to get Bibha.
But if he sent someone to bring Bibha, what would everyone think?
The courtiers would think he is effeminate, the minister would be secretly displeased, and Ramai the jester would laugh secretly!
Apart from that, what punishment would Pratapaditya get then?
Revenge was taken on the father-in-law, right?
Thinking about all this, he did not have the confidence or the inclination to send someone to bring Bibha.
In fact, he did not even have the courage to stop the jokes and laughter about Bibha, and thinking about Pratapaditya, he did not even want to stop it.

After the departure of the jester Ramai and the minister, Rammohan Mal came and said with folded hands, "Your Majesty!"

The king said, "What Rammohan!"

Rammohan: "Maharaj, give me your permission, I will go and bring Thakurani."

The king said, "What are you saying?"

Rammohan said, "Yes, your highness.
The inner apartments are empty, I cannot bear to see it.
When I go to the inner apartments and don't see anyone in the king's room, I feel restless.
May Goddess Lakshmi come to our home and brighten it up, so that we can feast our eyes on her."

The king said, "Raam Mohan, have you gone mad?
Should I bring that girl into my house?"

Rammohan said with wide-open eyes, "Why, Maharaj, what crime has my mother committed?"

The king said, "What are you saying Rammohan?
Should I bring Pratapaditya's daughter as my daughter-in-law?"

Rammohan said, "Why wouldn't you bring her?
What is Pratapaditya's relation to her?
Until the marriage takes place, the daughter belongs to her father; after the marriage, the father has no more rights over her.
Now your wife is yours—if you don't bring her home, if you don't respect her, then who else will?"

The king said, "It is enough that I have married Pratapaditya's daughter, why should I bring her home again?
How will my honor be protected then?"

Rammohan said, "Saving your honor?
You have kept your own wife in someone else's house, you have no right over her, anyone else can dominate her as they wish, does this save your honor?"

The king said, "What if Pratapaditya doesn't give his daughter?"

Rammohan puffed out his broad chest and said, "What did you say, Maharaj?
What if he doesn't give her?
Who is so capable that he won't give her?
My mother, the goddess of wealth of our household, who is capable of keeping her away from us?
No matter how great Pratapaditya is, I will snatch her from his hands.
Saying this, I'm leaving.
I will bring my mother back, who are you to stop me?"
Saying this, Rammohan started to leave.

The king said hurriedly, "Rammohan, don't go, listen, listen.
Okay, I have no objection to you bringing the queen, but—look—don't let anyone hear about this.
Don't let Ramai or the minister get wind of this!"

Rammohan said, "As you command, Your Majesty!" and left.

Although everyone will come to know as soon as the queen arrives in Rajpur, still there is a lot of delay, there is time to get ready for that, Ramchandra Ray will be saved if he can avoid the present shame.

## Chapter 20

Udayaditya's only effort day and night is to keep Bibha happy.
He does all her work with his own hands.
He himself brings her food, sits in front of her during meals, and does not let her suffer even the slightest inconvenience.
When Udayaditya comes to his room in the evening and sits down, covering his eyes with both hands and sitting still—perhaps tears start to fall from his eyes—then Bibha slowly comes and sits at his feet—tries to start a conversation, but cannot utter a word.
Both of them are silent, neither of them speaks.
The light of the dim lamp flickers from time to time, and with it a dark shadow trembles on the wall.
Bibha remains silent for a long time, looking at the shadow, her chest heaving with sighs, and she bursts into tears, "Where did he go, Dada?"
Udayaditya is startled, removes the covering from his eyes and looks at Bibha's face, as if he did not understand what Bibha said, as if he is trying to understand it, suddenly he regains consciousness, quickly wipes away his tears and comes to Bibha and says, "Come Bibha, let me tell you a story!"

It is a rainy day—very cloudy; it has been raining heavily all day long.
The day has turned dark, the trees and plants in the garden are standing still and getting drenched.
Every now and then the wind blows and raindrops splash inside the house.
Udayaditya sits silently; clouds rumble in the sky, lightning strikes in the horizon.
The incessant sound of the rain seems to be saying, "Surma is gone—she is no more."
Occasionally, the humid wind blows in gusts as if asking, "Where is Surma!"
Bibha slowly approaches Udayaditya and says, "Brother!"
He cannot respond, upon seeing Bibha, he covers his face, rests his head on the balcony railing, and lets the rain pour on his head.
The day passes by like this, evening approaches, and night begins to fall.
Bibha arranges Udayaditya's meal and comes back to say, "Brother, food is here, please eat!"
Udayaditya does not respond.
The night deepens.
Bibha cries and says, "Brother, get up, it's night."
Udayaditya looks up and sees Bibha crying; he quickly gets up, wipes Bibha's tears, and goes to eat.
He does not eat properly.
Bibha sighs upon seeing this and goes to bed, she does not eat anything either.

Bibha tries to talk, to tell stories, but Bibha cannot talk much; she cannot think of how to keep Udayaditya happy.
She only thinks, Oh, if only granduncle was here!

Nowadays, a kind of fear has arisen in Udayaditya's mind.
He is very afraid of Pratapaditya.
And he doesn't have the courage he used to have before.
He can no longer risk his life against tyranny, considering danger as insignificant.
He hesitates in all his actions, and doubts arise in all matters.

One day Udayaditya heard that an order had been given to send lathials to the zamindar's office at Chapara at night to loot the office and set fire to the office building.
Udayaditya immediately asked for his horse to be readied and went to the women's quarters.
He entered the bedroom and looked around.
He started thinking about something.
While thinking, he absent-mindedly started changing his clothes.
He came out.
A servant came and said, "Your Highness, the horse is ready.
Where do I take you?"
The prince looked at the servant's face absent-mindedly for a while and finally said, "Nowhere.
You take the horse away."

One day, upon hearing the sound of someone crying, Udayaditya came out and saw a royal official tying a subject to a tree and beating him.
The subject cried and looked at the crown prince's face and said, "Oh, Your Highness!"
The crown prince could not bear to see his suffering, so he quickly ran and entered the house.
In the past, he would have stopped the official without considering the consequences and tried to save the subject.

Bhagabat and Sitaram's stipends have been stopped.
The crown prince no longer has the courage to help them financially, either openly or secretly.
Whenever he hears about their suffering, he thinks to himself, "I will send them money today."
But then he starts hesitating and ends up not sending it.

Let no one think that Udayaditya is doing this out of fear for his life.
It is not that he has recently developed a greater attachment to life than before.
A blind fear has arisen in his mind.
He thinks of Pratapaditya as some kind of mysterious being!
As if Udayaditya's fate, Udayaditya's future life, is in Pratapaditya's fist every day, every moment.
Even when Udayaditya is about to embrace death, is in the last moments of his life, if Pratapaditya frowns and orders him to live, then he will have to come back from the jaws of death.

## Chapter 21

Widow Rukmini (Mangala) has some cash money.
She earns her living by investing that money and taking interest.
With the power of her beauty and money, she has kept many people under her control.
Sitaram is a carefree person, but he does not have a single penny at home.
Therefore, he is sincerely attracted to both Rukmini's beauty and money.
On the day when there is no food in the house, you can see Sitaram walking on the street with a stick in his hand, his thin sheet flying, his chest puffed out, and a completely carefree face.
He is going to Mangala's house.
If someone asks him on the way, "How are you, Sitaram?
How is your family doing?"
Sitaram immediately says with a smiling face, "It's going great!
We have been invited to a feast tomorrow!"
Sitaram's big talks have not diminished in the least.
Rather, as the situation worsens, the length and breadth of his speech increases.
Sitaram's condition is also getting worse.
Recently, it has become such that Pisha is thinking of giving up his honorary Pisha scholarship and returning to his homeland.

Today, there is a special need for money, so Sitaram has come to Rukmini's house.
Smiling, he came closer and said—

"If you give alms, Rai,

(My) gold and silver are of no use,

(I) have come at the cost of my life, O

I beg for the jewel of honor.”

No brother, the trick didn't quite work.
I don't have any immediate need for precious gems, if I do need them I'll see you later; for now, if I get some gold and silver, it will be useful!"

Rukmini suddenly expressed special affection and said, "If you need it, I won't give it to you, then who will I give it to?"

Sitaram hurriedly said, "No—is it really that urgent!
But you know brother, my mother keeps the money, I don't keep money in my own hands.
Today in the morning, mother went to her son-in-law's house in JoraGhat.
She forgot to take out the money.
But I will pay you back tomorrow!"

Mangala said with a smile to herself, "Why are you in such a hurry?
You can pay whenever it's convenient.
I'm giving it to you, I'm not throwing it in the water, am I?"
Even if you throw it in the water, there's still a chance of getting it back, but if you give it to Sitaram, there's no chance at all.
That's the difference.

Seeing such signs of affection from Mangala, Sitaram's love surged up.
Sitaram tried to make jokes.
It was Sitaram's nature to act like a nawab without money and to crack jokes without humor.
He said whatever came to his mind and laughed without waiting for anyone else.
Seeing his laughter made one laugh!
When he was a guard at the royal palace, Sitaram and the other guards often got into trouble because Sitaram found things funny that others didn't.
Hanumanprasad Tewari was dozing off while on guard duty, and Sitaram slowly went behind him and suddenly kicked him in the back so hard that the pain from that bone-jarring joke made his back and his gall bladder burn at the same time.
Sitaram started laughing loudly, but Hanumanprasad didn't join in the laughter.
Instead, he used an example to very clearly explain to Sitaram the difference between a kick and a joke and the relationship between humor and pathos.
Hundreds of other stories about Sitaram's jokes could be told here.

As said before, Sitaram's affection suddenly surged, he moved closer to Rukmini and lovingly said, ""You are my Subhadra, I am your Jagannath.""

Rukmini said, "Mor Minse.
Subhadra is Jagannath's sister!"

Sitaram said, "How can that be?
Then how did the abduction of Subhadra happen!"

Rukmini started laughing, SeetaRam puffed out his chest and said, "No, that won't do, it won't do to laugh, answer me!
If Subhadra was your sister, then how did the abduction of Subhadra happen?"

Sitaram believes that he has presented such strong arguments that there is nothing more to be said on the matter.

Rukmini said in a very sweet voice, "Away, fool."

Sitaram went to the alley and said, "You are such a fool, I have lost my brother to you, I am always a fool to you!"
Sitaram thought to himself, I have given a very good answer, I have added good words.

He said again, "Alright brother, if you don't like the word, what should I call you that would make you happy?
Tell me!"

Rukmini said with a smile, "Speak, my dear."

Sitaram said, "My love!"

Rukmini said, "Tell me, my love."

Sitaram said, "Darling!"

Rukmini said, "Speak, my beloved!"

Sitaram said, "My beloved!"

Rukmini said, "Speak, my love."

Sitaram said, "My beloved!"

"Alright brother, my love, how much interest will you charge for the money you gave?"

Rukmini got angry, turned her face away and said, "Go away, go away, so this is your love!
How can you ask me about interest?"

Sitaram, elated with joy, exclaimed, "No no, how can that be?
Was I speaking the truth, my dear?
I was just joking, couldn't you understand that?
Fie on you, my beloved!"

I don't know what illness Sita Ram's mother has, but these days he often visits his in-laws' house and his memory about paying money has completely disappeared!
Therefore, Sita Ram had to come to Rukmini's house often.
These days it is seen that Sita Ram and Rukmini are secretly discussing something.
After a long discussion, Sita Ram said, "My brother is not that clever.
We won't be able to do this without Bhagabat's help."

That day in the evening there was a huge storm.
The doors of the palace were banging loudly.
The wind was blowing so fast that the branches of the big trees in the garden were swaying and touching the ground.
Like villages destroyed by floods, the clouds were scattered and running away in the face of the storm.
Frequent lightning, frequent thunder.
Udayaditya closed all the doors and sat with a little girl in his lap.
He had turned off the lamp in the room.
The room was dark.
The girl fell asleep in his lap.
When Surma was alive, she loved this girl very much.
After Surma's death, her mother did not send her to the palace anymore.
After many days, she came to visit the palace today.
Suddenly seeing Udayaditya, she jumped into his lap, calling him "Uncle", "Uncle".
Udayaditya hugged her tightly and brought her to his bedroom.
Udayaditya thought, "If Surma could see this girl once!
How much she loved her!
She loved her so much, how could she not come!"
The girl asked once, "Uncle, where is Aunty?"

Udayaditya said in a choked voice, "Call her once."
The girl started calling, "Aunty, Aunty."
Udayaditya felt as if someone responded.
From afar, it seemed as if someone said, "I'm coming, my child!"
As if the affectionate mother could not resist her affectionate daughter's pitiful call and was coming to take her in her arms.
The girl fell asleep in her lap.
Udayaditya turned off the lamp.
He sat alone in the dark room with a sleeping girl in his arms.
The wind was blowing outside.
There was a creaking sound here and there.
Was that the sound of footsteps?
Yes, it was footsteps.
His heart was beating so fast that he could not hear the sound properly.
The door opened, and light entered the room.
Was this even possible?
A woman entered the room silently with a lamp in her hand.
Udayaditya closed his eyes and said, "Is it Surma?"
He was afraid that if he saw Surma, she would go away.
He was afraid that it might not be Surma.

Ramani kept the lamp and said, "Why, don't you remember me anymore?"

The sound of thunder broke his dream.
Udayaditya woke up with a start and opened his eyes.
The girl woke up and started crying, calling him "uncle".
Udayaditya got out of bed and stood up, not knowing what to do or where to go.
Rukmini came near him and said, "Now you remember me, don't you?
Why did you give me hope and then leave me hanging?"
Udayaditya stood there silently, unable to say anything.

Then Rukmini took out her ultimate weapon.
She said while crying, "What wrong have I done to you that I have become a thorn in your eyes?
You are the one who destroyed me.
The woman who sold her body and soul to the crown prince is now wandering on the streets like a beggar.
Did the creator write this on my burning forehead?"

This time Udayaditya's heart was struck with pain.
Suddenly he felt that he was the one who had ruined her.
He forgot the past.
He forgot how Rukmini had tempted him at every step during his wild youth, how she used to lay traps in front of his path every day, how she had surrounded him with her two enchanting arms like a whirlpool and thrown him into the darkness of hell within moments—he forgot all that.
He saw that Rukmini's clothes were dirty and torn; Rukmini was crying!
The compassionate Udayaditya said, "What do you want?"

Rukmini said, "I don't want anything else, I want your love.
I want to sit in that balcony, rest my head on your chest and receive your affection.
Why, is my face darker than Surma's?
Even if it is dark, it is because of you, traveling from place to place.
It wasn't dark before."

Saying this, Rukmini went to sit on Udayaditya's bed.
Udayaditya could not bear it any longer.
He cried out in anguish, "Oh, don't sit on the bed, don't sit."

Rukmini raised her head like a wounded snake and said, "Why shouldn't I sit?"

Udayaditya blocked her way and said, "No, don't go near the bed!
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you right now."

Rukmini said, "Alright, give me that ring on your finger."

Udayaditya immediately took the ring off her hand and threw it away.
Rukmini picked it up and went outside.
She thought to herself, "The spell of the witch is still not broken, let some more days pass, then my spell will work."
After Rukmini left, Udayaditya fell on the bed.
Covering his face with both hands, he cried and said, "Where, where is Surma!
Who will give peace to my burnt and thunderbolt-struck heart today?"

## Chapter 22

Bhagabat's condition is not good.
He has been sitting silently and smoking tobacco continuously for a few days.
When Bhagabat smokes tobacco with concentration, it becomes a cause of concern for the neighbors.
Because, black smoke starts coming out of his mouth, and a similar black factory of thoughts starts running in his mind.
But Bhagabat is a very religious person.
He doesn't socialize with anyone, that's his only fault.
He keeps a garland of holy basil beads, doesn't talk much, and doesn't gossip.
But when someone falls into serious trouble, no one can give better advice than Bhagabat.
Bhagabat never intentionally harms others, but if someone else harms him, Bhagabat never forgets it in this life.
He takes revenge and only then puts down his hookah.
In a word, Bhagabat is what is called a good person in the world!
The people of the neighborhood also respect him.
Bhagabat had borrowed money during difficult times, but he has repaid it by selling his utensils.

One morning, Sitaram came and asked Bhagavat, "Brother, how are you?"

Bhagavat said, "Not good."

Sitaram said, "Why, tell me?"

Bhagbhat smoked tobacco for a while and then handed the hookah to Sitaram, saying, "There's a lot of tension."

Sitaram said, "Really?
How did that happen?"

Bhagbhat, slightly annoyed in his mind, said, "How did it happen?
Do you have to tell me that too?
I knew that my condition is the same as yours!"

Sitaram said with some hesitation, "No, I am not saying that, I am asking why don't you borrow?"

Bhagavat said, "If you take a loan, you will have to pay it back.
How will you pay it back?
You don't have many things to sell or mortgage."

Sitaram said proudly, "How much money do you need to borrow, I will give it to you."

Bhagavat said, "Really?
If you have so much money that throwing a handful into the water doesn't matter, then give me ten coins.
But I'm telling you in advance, I don't have the power to purify!"

Sitaram said, "For that, Dada, you don't have to worry."

Upon receiving such help from Sitaram, Bhagavat did not become overly excited with the enthusiasm of friendship.
He prepared another chillum of tobacco, sat down silently, and began to smoke.

Sitaram slowly started a conversation, "Brother, because of the king's unjust judgment, we are starving."

Bhagabat said - "Well, it didn't seem like that from your expressions!"
Bhagabat couldn't tolerate Sitaram's generosity, he was a little annoyed in his mind!

Sitaram said, "No, brother, I am speaking the truth!
If you don't go today, you will have to go after ten days."

Bhagavat said - "Well, if the king delivers an unjust verdict, what can we do?"

Sitaram said, "Alas, when the crown prince becomes the king, then Ramrajya will be established in Jashore.
May we live to see that day."

Bhagavat got annoyed and said, "What do we have to do with all this talk, brother?
You are a great man, you can sit in your own house and kill the king and the minister, that's fine—I am a poor man, I don't have that much confidence!"

Sitaram said, "Why are you angry, brother?
Why don't you listen to what I have to say?"
Saying this, he started to say something in a hushed tone.

Bhagbhat became furious and said, "Listen, Sitaram, I am telling you clearly, don't you dare utter such words in front of me."

Sitaram left that day.
Bhagabat spent the whole day thinking about something with great concentration, the next morning he himself went to Sitaram.
He said to Sitaram, "The thing you said yesterday was very wise."

Sitaram proudly said, "Didn't I tell you, brother!"

Bhagabat said, "I have come to consult you about that matter today."

Sitaram became even more proud.
For a few days, gradual consultation began to take place.

After consultation, it was decided that a forged petition would be written, in which it would be alleged that Crown Prince Pratapaditya was planning to rebel against the emperor in order to seize the kingdom for himself.
The petition would bear the Crown Prince's seal.
Rukmini had brought a ring that bore the Crown Prince's seal engraved with his name, so the plan was already well underway.

The work was done as advised.
A draft application was written, in which the name of the prince was printed.
Ignorant Sitaram cannot be relied upon, therefore it was decided that Bhagabat himself would take the application and hand it over to Dilishwar.

Bhagabat took the petition and instead of going to Delhi, he went to Pratap Aditya.
He told the Maharaja, "One of Udayaditya's servants was taking this petition to Delhi, I somehow found out.
The servant has fled the country, I am bringing the petition to the Maharaja."
Bhagabat did not mention Sitaram's name.
It is needless to say what Pratap Aditya's condition was after reading the petition.
Bhagabat got his job back in the palace.

## Chapter 23

Darkness has enveloped Bibha's soul.
In the future, some heart-wrenching sorrow, a despairing desolation, the renunciation of all the happiness of life, awaits her, approaching her with each passing moment.
The fear of that life-draining, all-consuming, dry, boundless, uncertain future has cast a shadow upon Bibha's soul.
What is Bibha feeling in her heart?
Bibha lies alone on her bed.
At this moment, Bibha has no one by her side.
Bibha sighed, Bibha cried, Bibha became distraught and said, "Have you abandoned me?
What wrong have I done to you?"
She continued to cry and say, "What wrong have I done?"
Covering her face with both hands, she held the pillow to her chest and cried repeatedly, "What have I done?"
"Not a single letter, not a single person has come, I hear no news from anyone's mouth.
What am I to do?
My heart is breaking, I am pacing restlessly from room to room all day long, no one tells me any news of you, I hear your name from no one's mouth!
Mother, oh mother, how will I pass the days!"
How many days have passed like this?
How many afternoons, how many evenings, how many nights has Bibha, bereft of companionship, wandered like a thin shadow through the empty rooms of the palace!

One day at such a time, Rammohan came in the morning and said, "Mother, victory to you," and bowed down to her.
Bibha was so startled, as if a thunderbolt of happiness had struck her head.
Tears came out of her eyes.
She became alert and said, "Mohan, you came!"

"Yes mother, I saw that mother has forgotten us, let me go and remind her once!"

Bibha thought of asking so many things but couldn't due to shyness—couldn't bring herself to ask—yet her heart was eager to hear.

Rammohan looked at Bibha's face and said, "Why, mother, why is your face so gloomy?
There are dark circles under your eyes.
There is no smile on your face.
Your hair is rough.
Come, mother, come to our house.
I guess there is no one here to take care of you!"

Bibha gave a faint smile; she didn't say anything!
Her laughter gradually faded away.
Tears started to fall from her eyes—flooding her thin, pale cheeks, the tears wouldn't stop!
After so many days of neglect, when she received a little affection, the resentment welled up inside her.
Bibha burst into tears with that very tender, gentle, infinitely loving resentment.
She thought to herself, "After all this time, he remembered me?"

Rammohan couldn't hold himself back, tears welled up in his eyes, he said - "What a bad omen!
Goddess Lakshmi, please come to our house with a smiling face.
Please wipe away the tears from our eyes on this auspicious day!"

The queen was afraid in her mind, lest her son-in-law does not accept her daughter.
She was very happy to hear that Rammohan has come to take Bibha.
She called Rammohan and asked about the well-being of his family, fed Rammohan with special care, listened to Rammohan's stories, and spent the day in joy!
Tomorrow is a good day for the journey; she decided to send Bibha tomorrow morning.
Pratapaditya did not object to this anymore.

When everything for the journey was finalized, Bibha went to Udayaditya.
Udayaditya was sitting alone, thinking about something.

Seeing Bibha, he was slightly startled and said, "Bibha, so you are leaving?
Well, that's good!
You will be happy.
I bless you—may you be like Lakshmi and brighten your husband's home!"

Bibha fell at Udayaditya's feet and started crying.
Tears started flowing from Udayaditya's eyes;—placing his hand on Bibha's head he said,—“Why are you crying?
What happiness did you have here Bibha; all around there was only sorrow, pain, grief.
You escaped from this prison—you are saved!”

When Bibha got up, Udayaditya said, "Are you leaving?
Then come.
I hope you won't forget us completely after going to your husband's house.
Remember us sometimes, and send us news from time to time."

Bibha went to Rammohan and said, "I can't go now!"

Ramamohan said in surprise, "What are you saying, mother?"

Bibha said, "No, I cannot go.
I cannot leave Dada alone now.
All this pain and suffering of his is because of me, and today I will leave him here and go to enjoy myself?
As long as there is even a tiny bit of pain in his mind, I will stay with him.
Who else will take care of him like I do?"
Saying this, Bibha cried and left.

A commotion broke out in the women's quarters.
The queen came and started rebuking Bibha; she threatened her with dire consequences and gave her a lot of advice; Bibha simply said—"No mother, I can't do it!"

The queen, vexed and annoyed, said tearfully, "I have never seen such a girl anywhere!"
She went to the king and told him everything.
The king calmly said, "Well then, if Bibha doesn't want to go, why should she?"

The queen was astonished, she turned her hand, let go of the plough and said, "Do whatever you want, I will not say anything more."

Udayaditya was astonished after hearing everything.
He came to Bibha and tried to make her understand a lot; Bibha started crying silently, she didn't understand properly!

Hopeless Rammohan came and said with a gloomy face, "Mother, then I shall leave.
What shall I tell the Maharaja?"

Bibha couldn't say anything, she remained silent for a long time!

Rammohan said, "Then goodbye mother!"
Saying this, he bowed down and left.
Bibha started crying in distress, and called out in a plaintive voice, "Mohan!"

Mohan returned and said, "What is it, mother?"

Bibha said, "Tell Maharaj, to please forgive me.
Even though he himself is calling me, I couldn't go, is it just my sheer bad luck?"

Rammohan said dryly, "As you command!"

Rammohan bowed again and took his leave.
Bibha noticed that Rammohan couldn't understand her feelings at all, he seemed very confused.
On one hand, Bibha couldn't go where her heart desired; on top of that, Rammohan, whom she truly loved, left angrily today.
Only Bibha knows what happened to her soul!

Bibha remained.
Wiping away her tears and carrying the weight of a stone in her heart, she fell at her grandfather's feet.
Pale and thin, like a shadow, she silently did all the household chores.
When Udayaditya showed her affection and asked her something, she lowered her eyes and smiled a little.
In the evening, she tried to talk a little while sitting at Udayaditya's feet.
When the queen scolded her and said something, she stood silently and listened, and finally drifted away like a piece of dark cloud.
When someone held Bibha's chin and said, "Bibha, why are you getting so thin?"
Bibha didn't say anything, she just smiled a little.

At this time, Bhagavat shows Pratapaditya the aforementioned forged petition, Pratapaditya became furious—after much deliberation, he ordered Udayaditya to be imprisoned.
The minister said, "Your Majesty, it is impossible to believe that the crown prince has done this.
Whoever hears it, their tongue will be cut off for saying it, it is unbearable to hear.
It is not believable that the crown prince would do this."
Pratapaditya said, "We don't really believe it either.
But what harm is there in keeping him in prison?
As long as he is not subjected to any hardship there.
Only guards will be posted so that he cannot do anything in secret."

## Chapter 24

When Rammohan returned to Chandradwip and stood alone in front of the king with folded hands like a guilty person, Ramchandra Ray's whole body burned with anger.
He had decided that when Bibha came, he would make her listen to some harsh words about Pratapaditya and his lineage, and in this way, he would take revenge on his father-in-law.
He had already decided in his mind what he would say, how he would say it, and when he would say it.
Ramchandra Ray was not from Goa, and he had no intention of torturing Bibha in any way.
He was simply impatient to embarrass Bibha about her father from time to time.
In fact, in the excitement of this pleasure, it did not even occur to him that there could be any obstacle to Bibha's arrival.
At such a time, seeing Rammohan coming alone, Ramchandra Ray was completely surprised and exclaimed, "What happened, Rammohan?"

Rammohan said, "Everything has been in vain!"

The king exclaimed in surprise, "Couldn't bring it?"

Rammohan - "Your Majesty, no!
I started my journey at an auspicious time!"

The king became very angry and exclaimed, "Who told you, you rascal, to set out on a journey?
I repeatedly forbade you at that time, but you puffed out your chest and went anyway.
And today—"

Rammohan placed his hand on his forehead and said with a gloomy face, "Your Majesty, it's my ill fate!"

Ramchandra Ray became even more furious and said, "Insult to Ramchandra Ray!
You rascal, you went begging in my name, and Pratapaditya didn't give you anything.
Such a big insult has never happened to our family before."

Then Rammohan, lifting his bowed head, said with a bit of pride, "Don't say that.
If Pratapaditya hadn't given it, I would have snatched it.
That's why I went to you.
Maharaj, when I go to carry out your orders, do I fear Pratapaditya?
Pratapaditya is a king, but he is not my king."

The king said, "Then why didn't it happen?"

Rammohan remained silent for a long time, tears welled up in his eyes.

The king said impatiently, "Rammohan, tell me quickly."

Rammohan folded his hands and said, "Your Majesty-"

The king said, "What do you say?"

Rammohan - "Maharaj, Ma-Thakurun did not want to come."
Saying this, tears started to fall from Rammohan's eyes.
It seemed like the tears of a proud son.
Perhaps the meaning of these tears was - "I had so much faith in my mother that with the strength of that faith, I went to bring my mother with my chest puffed out and with joy, and mother did not come; mother did not uphold my honor."
Who knows what old Rammohan was thinking, he could not control the tears in his eyes.

Upon hearing this, the king stood up abruptly, widened his eyes and exclaimed, "Oh!"
He could not speak for a long time.

"He didn't want to come, did he!
You rascal, get out, get out of my sight this instant."

Ramnohon left without saying a word!
He knew all his faults, so it was not unfair to receive appropriate punishment.

The king could not think of any way to take revenge for this.
He could not do anything to Pratapaditya, and Bibha was also not within his reach.
Ramchandra Ray started pacing anxiously.

Within a couple of days, the news spread far and wide in various forms.
The situation became such that it was impossible to save face without taking revenge.
Even the subjects became restless to take revenge.
They said, "It's an insult to our Maharaja!"
It was as if the insult had touched everyone.
Ramchandra Ray was naturally vengeful, and on top of that, he began to think, what would the subjects think if he didn't take revenge, what would the servants think, what would the jester Ramai think?
When he imagined Mai and another person laughing and joking about this matter, he became very restless.

One day in the court, the minister proposed, "Your Majesty, you should marry again!"

Ramai the jester said, "And Pratapaditya's daughter should live with her brother!"

Looking at Raja Ramai, he said with a smile, "You are right, Ramai."

Seeing the king laugh, all the courtiers started laughing.
Only Fernandez was annoyed, he didn't laugh.
People like Ramchandra Rai are always busy saving face, but they have no idea what face is or how to save it!

The Dewan said, "The minister is right.
In that case, Pratapaditya and his daughter should be given excellent education."

Ramai the jester said, "In this auspicious occasion, don't forget to send an invitation letter to your current father-in-law, otherwise who knows, he might feel offended!"
Saying this, Ramai winked.
Everyone in the assembly started laughing; those who were sitting far away and couldn't hear what was said, couldn't help but laugh either.

Ramai said, "To welcome her, you should send your mother-in-law to Jashore among the ladies.
And when you send a platter of sweets to Pratapaditya's daughter, send two raw plantains along with it."

The king laughed and became restless.
The courtiers covered their mouths with their shawls and turned their faces away to laugh.
Fernandes got up unnoticed and left.

The Dewanji tried to crack a joke once, saying, "Oh sweetmeat-loving friends, if all the sweets are destined for other people, then all the sweets would be consumed in Jashore itself, leaving no sweets for people in Chandradwip to eat!"

No one felt like laughing after hearing those words.
The king remained silent and started smoking his hookah, the courtiers became serious, looked at Dewan Ramai in surprise, and one of the ministers even asked in a depressed tone, "What are you saying, Dewanji?
Will the sweets for the king's wedding be so less?"
Dewanji started scratching his head.

The marriage was all settled.

## Chapter 25

The place where Udayaditya has been confined is not an actual prison.
It is a small tower attached to the palace.
There is a royal road to the right of the building and a wide wall to the east, where guards are patrolling and keeping watch.
There is a very small window in the room.
Through it, one can see a bit of the sky, a bamboo grove, and a Shiva temple.
When Udayaditya first entered the prison, the evening had already passed.
He went and sat on the floor, facing the window.
It is the rainy season.
The sky is covered with clouds.
The streets are flooded.
In the silent night, occasionally one or two travelers are walking, the sound of their footsteps splashing in the water.
From the east, like the heartbeat of the prison, the sound of the guards' footsteps can be heard continuously.
As each hour passes, a call can be heard from afar.
There is not a single star in the sky.
The bamboo grove that Udayaditya is looking at is completely covered with fireflies.
Udayaditya did not sleep that night.
He sat by the window and listened to the incessant footsteps of the guards.

Bibha went to the garden of the inner palace once in the evening.
I think there were many people in the palace.
Everywhere there were servants, everywhere there were maidservants, who kept asking, "What happened, what's the news?"
She had to account for every tear she shed, every sigh she heaved was subjected to detailed commentary and criticism.
Bibha couldn't take it anymore, she ran to the garden.
The sun had risen and set amidst the clouds today.
It was hard to tell when the day ended and the evening began.
In the afternoon, a thin line of gold had appeared in the western sky, but it had disappeared before the day was over.
Darkness upon darkness began to thicken.
The horizon was covered from one end to the other.
Darkness settled upon the heads of the dense rows of casuarina trees in such a way that the space between them was no longer visible.
It seemed as if a vast, silent darkness was standing on a thousand long legs.
Night fell, the lamps of the palace went out one by one.
Bibha sat under the casuarina tree.
Bibha was naturally timid, but today she was not afraid.
Only, as the darkness grew, she felt as if someone was taking the world away from her; as if someone had pushed her away from happiness, from peace, from the shores of the world; she had fallen into an ocean of impenetrable darkness; she was sinking deeper and deeper, the darkness above her head was increasing, there was no ground beneath her feet, there was nothing around her, shelter, shore, the world was receding further and further away.
She felt as if a vast gap was rising up in front of her, bit by bit, towards the sky.
How much was left behind it.
Her heart seemed to ache.
As if everything on the other side could be seen; the sunlight there, the games, the festivals, everything could be seen; someone was holding her back cruelly, with a hard hand, not letting her go in that direction even if he tore the veins of her chest.
Bibha seemed to have gained divine vision today; as if the Creator had written Bibha's future destiny on this thick, dark darkness that pervaded the universe, Bibha sat alone in the infinite world and seemed to be reading it; that's why there were no tears in her eyes, her body was still, her eyes were unblinking.
After two hours of the night, a wind blew; the trees and plants in the darkness rustled.
The wind blew far away, crying like a baby in a baby's voice.
Bibha felt as if her beloved, affectionate, loving children were sitting on the seashore far, far away, stretching out their hands and crying, calling out to Bibha in anguish, they wanted to come to her lap, they could not see the way in front of them; as if their cries pierced through hundreds of leagues, thousands of leagues of thick, silent darkness and reached Bibha's ears.
Bibha's heart seemed to cry out in anguish, "Who are you, who are you crying, where are you!"
Bibha seemed to travel alone on this path of darkness for thousands of leagues in her mind.
She seemed to travel tirelessly for a thousand years, the path did not end, she did not see anyone; - only in that airless, soundless, dayless, nightless, deserted, starless, directionless, great darkness, she stood and heard cries from all sides from time to time, only the wind blew from afar, howling!

The whole night passed without sleep.
The next day Bibha tried a lot to go to Udayaditya in the prison, but she was forbidden to go there.
She cried a lot the whole day.
She even went to Pratapaditya himself.
Bibha held his feet.
With great difficulty, she got his consent.
The next day, as soon as the morning dawned, Bibha got out of bed and entered the prison.
When she went, she saw that Udayaditya was not sleeping on the bed.
He was sitting on the floor, sleeping with his head on the balcony.
Seeing this, Bibha's heart felt like bursting out crying.
With great difficulty, she controlled her tears.
She went and sat near Udayaditya very slowly and silently.
Gradually the morning became clear.
Birds started chirping from the nearby forest.
Travelers started singing songs from the nearby highway.
Seeing the light, one or two tired guards who had been awake all night started singing softly.
The sound of conch and bell came from the nearby temple.
Udayaditya suddenly woke up with a start.
Seeing Bibha, he said, "What Bibha, so early in the morning?"
Looking around the room, he said, "What is this - where am I?"
Within a moment, he remembered where he was!
Looking at Bibha, he sighed and said, "Ah - Bibha, have you come?
I didn't see you the whole day yesterday, I thought, I might not see you again."

Bibha came to Udayaditya, wiped her eyes and said, "Brother, why are you sitting on the floor?
The bed is spread on the cot.
It seems you haven't sat on the cot even once.
Have you been sitting on the floor for the last two days?"
Saying this, Bibha started crying.

Udayaditya said slowly, "Bibha, when I sit on the cot, I can't see the sky!
When I look up at the sky through the window and see the birds flying, I feel that one day we will break the cage, one day I too will swim in the boundless sky with life like those birds.
When I move away from this window, I see darkness all around, then I forget that one day I will be free, one day I will be liberated, I don't think that the shackles of life will break one day, one day I will be free from this prison.
Bibha, within this prison there are two handfuls of land, where when I come, I realize that I am naturally free; no king or emperor can hold me captive.
And over there, in that room, that soft bed, that's my prison."

Today, seeing Bibha suddenly, Udayaditya felt immense joy in his heart.
When Bibha caught his eye, it was as if all the doors of his prison had been flung open.
That day, he had made Bibha sit close to him and had spoken so much with joy that he felt he had never spoken so much before his imprisonment.
Bibha had understood that joy of Udayaditya in her heart.
I do not know how a message goes from one soul to another, how when a wave rises in one soul, a wave rises in another soul according to some rule.
Bibha's heart was filled with joy.
Her long-cherished goal had been achieved today.
Bibha, a mere girl, suddenly realized today that she could give Udayaditya the joy that he had been missing for so long.
She gained strength in her heart.
For so long, she had seen darkness all around, she could not find a shore anywhere, she had completely succumbed to the heavy burden of despair.
She had no faith in herself; she worked tirelessly for Udayaditya, but she could not believe that she could make him happy.
Today, she suddenly saw a path, and all the fatigue of the past days was forgotten.
Today, tears like the morning dew appeared in her eyes, today a pure smile like the morning sun bloomed on her lips.

Bibha also became almost a prisoner.
Whenever the morning light entered through the balcony of the house, the prison door would open and Bibha's radiant figure would appear.
Bibha did not let the paid servants do anything, she did all the work with her own hands, she herself brought food, she herself made the bed.
She brought a parrot and hung it in the room and every morning she would pick flowers from the garden of the inner courtyard and bring them.
There was a Mahabharata in the room, Udayaditya would make Bibha sit near him and read it out to her.

But there is a pain lurking in Udayaditya's mind.
He is already drowning, so why is he embracing the delicate Bibha as a refuge in this incomplete happiness, unfulfilled hope, and drowning her too?
Every day he thinks he will tell Bibha, "You go away, Bibha!"
But when Bibha enters the prison with the air of dawn, the light of dawn, holding the hand of the young dawn, when she comes and sits down with that face full of affection, how carefully and lovingly she looks at him once, how sweetly she asks so many questions, then he can't bring himself to say, "Bibha, you go away, you don't come here anymore, I won't see you again."
Every day he thinks, tomorrow I will say it; but that tomorrow never seems to come!
Finally one day he made a firm decision.
Bibha came, he told Bibha, "Bibha, you don't stay here anymore.
I can't find peace unless you leave.
Every evening in the darkness of this prison, someone seems to come and tell me that Bibha's danger is approaching.
Bibha, run away from me quickly!
I am Saturn, whenever I am seen, danger to the country comes running from all sides.
You go to your in-laws' house.
If I get news from time to time, then I will be happy."

Bibha remained silent.

Udayaditya lowered his head and kept looking at Bibha's face for a long time.
Tears started to fall from his eyes in a stream.
Udayaditya realized, "If I am not released from prison, Bibha will never leave me, how can I get released!"

## Chapter 26

Ramchandra Ray thought that Bibha did not come to Chandradwip only because of Pratapaditya's rule and Udayaditya's advice.
He felt deeply offended at the thought that Bibha did not come of her own accord.
He thought that Pratapaditya wanted to insult him and therefore he would never send Bibha to him.
But why should he not return this insult?
Why should he not write a letter to him saying that he was rejecting his daughter and that she should not be sent to Chandradwip again?
After thinking about it this way and consulting with five people, a letter to that effect was written to Pratapaditya.
It was not an act of ordinary courage to write such a letter to Pratapaditya.
Ramchandra Ray was very scared in his mind.
But just as one cannot stop in the middle of descending a steep slope, even though one is filled with fear, a similar feeling had arisen in Ramchandra Ray's mind—he had suddenly embarked on a daring venture and it seemed that he could not stop until he reached the end.
He called Rammohan and said, "Take this letter to Jashore."
Rammohan folded his hands and said, "No, Your Majesty, I cannot do it.
I have decided that I will not go to Jashore again.
If you ask me to go and bring Mother Thakurani back again, then I can go once more, otherwise I cannot take this letter."
Without saying anything more to Rammohan, the king handed over the letter to the old Nayanchand.
He took the letter and set off for Jashore.

He took the letter, but Nayanchand became very scared.
He did not know what Pratap Aditya would do if this letter fell into his hands.
After much thought and consideration, he decided to give the letter to his wife.
His wife's mental state was not good.
On one hand, she was worried about Bibha, and on the other hand, she was distressed about Udayaditya.
She had become completely overwhelmed by the turmoil in her family life.
Sometimes, she would be seen crying.
She seemed to have lost interest in household chores.
In this state of mind, she received this letter—she did not know what to do.
She could not tell Bibha anything; otherwise, the delicate Bibha would not survive.
If the Maharaj came to know about this letter, there was no telling what disaster would befall them.
Yet, in such a critical situation, the queen could not live without telling someone or seeking advice from someone.
Seeing no way out, the queen went to Pratap Aditya while crying.
She said, "Maharaj, something must be done about Bibha."

Pratapaditya said, "Why, tell me?"

The queen said, "No, nothing has happened yet—but Bibha will have to be sent to her in-laws' house sooner or later!"

Pratapaditya - "I understand that, but why did you suddenly remember it today after so many days?"

The queen said fearfully, "That's just your opinion.
Am I saying that something has happened?
If something happens-"

Pratapaditya said in annoyance, "What else will happen?"

Mahishi—"Think about this, what if my son-in-law completely abandons Bibha."
Saying this, Mahishi started crying with a choked voice.

Pratapaditya became extremely angry.
Sparks of fire came out of his eyes.

Upon seeing the king's statue, the queen wiped her tears and quickly said, "Having said that, did my son-in-law really write that, 'Oh, send Bibha away, I am leaving her, don't send her to Chandradwip again'?
No, that's not it—but the thing is, what if he writes that someday!"

Pratapaditya said - "I will make arrangements for that later, I don't have time to think about that now."

The queen cried and said, "Maharaj, I fall at your feet, please grant me one request.
Think carefully about what will happen to Bibha!
My heart of stone has kept me alive until now, otherwise you have tortured me as much as you could.
You have imprisoned Uday—my darling son, the prince—like a common criminal.
He has never wronged anyone, he has never been involved in anything, he doesn't understand the concept of guilt, he hasn't learned statecraft, he doesn't know how to rule subjects, he doesn't have the intelligence.
What is his fault in what God has made him?"
Saying this, the queen cried even more.

Pratapaditya said with a hint of annoyance, "We have discussed that matter many times.
Tell me what we were talking about."

The queen hit her forehead and said, "Oh, my ill fate!
What more can I say?
Will you listen to me if I say something?
Maharaj, look at Bibha's face just once!
She doesn't say anything to anyone—she just withers away day by day, becoming like a shadow, but she doesn't know how to speak up!
Do something about it."

Pratapaditya became annoyed—the queen returned without saying anything more.

## Chapter 27

In the meantime, an incident had occurred.
When Sitaram saw that Udayaditya had been imprisoned, he could no longer sit idle.
First, he went to Rukmini's house.
He said whatever came to his mouth.
He almost beat her up!
He said, "You wretch, I will set your house on fire, I will make owls hoot in your courtyard, and I will free the crown prince, or else my name is not Sitaram!
Today itself, I am going to Raigarh, I will come back from Raigarh, and then I will rub your ugly face on this whetstone, I will smear your face with lime and charcoal and throw you out of the city, only then will I drink water!"

Rukmini listened to Sitaram's words for a while with unblinking eyes.
Gradually, her teeth started to chatter, her lips pressed together, her fists clenched tightly, dark clouds gathered over her thick black eyebrows, lightning began to gather in her thick black eyes, and her whole body became motionless.
Gradually, her thick lower lip began to tremble, her thick eyebrows fluttered, lightning flashed in her dark eyes, her hair puffed up, and her hands and feet began to tremble.
A demonic curse, a trembling violence that filled her whole body seemed to fall on Sitaram's head.
At that moment, Sitaram left the cottage.
Gradually, as Rukmini's fists relaxed, her teeth unclenched, her lips parted, and her furrowed brows unfurrowed, she sat down and said, "Of course!
The crown prince is yours.
You are so concerned because the crown prince is in danger—as if the crown prince is not mine.
You fool, don't you know that he is my crown prince, that I can do him good
and I can do him harm?
You want to free my crown prince.
Let's see how you can do that."

Sitaram left for Raigarh that very day.

In the afternoon, Basanta Ray is sitting on the verandah of Raigarh palace.
A vast field can be seen in front.
On the other side of the canal at the edge of the field, the sun is setting amidst a mango grove.
Basanta Ray is not holding his constant companion, the sitar, in his hands.
The old man is looking at the setting sun and humming a song to himself.

I am the only one left, Rainu.

Whatever was there is gone, what remains is just an illusion.

Those who used to say that I am,

And they don't respond anymore,

Where are they, where are they?
Whom do I call out to, crying and crying?

Tell me, mother, I ask you,

Did you keep some for "me"?

I barely survive with just myself.

Who knows what the old man was thinking about as he sang this song.
Perhaps he was thinking, "I am singing a song, but those to whom I used to sing are no more.
The song comes to me naturally, but there is no more joy in singing it.
I have not forgotten happiness yet, but whenever happiness arises, where are those whom I longed to embrace?
On the day when clouds used to form over that palm tree in Raigarh in the morning, my heart would dance with joy.
On that very day, I would set out on a journey to Jashore to see those whom I loved.
Will I never see them again?
Even now, my heart sometimes dances with joy like that, but alas—perhaps thinking of all this, the old Basanta Ray started singing to himself this afternoon as he looked at the setting sun—"I am the only one left."

At that moment Khan Saheb arrived and gave a deep bow.
Seeing Khan Saheb, Basanta Ray became cheerful and said, "Khan Saheb, come, come!"
He went a little closer and said anxiously, "Saheb, why do I see your face so gloomy?
Are you in a good mood?"

Khan Saheb - "Don't ask me about my mood, Maharaj.
Seeing you so gloomy, our minds are not at peace!
There is a saying - 'I am nothing in the night, the moon that I hold above my head, I laugh with it and fade away with it.'
- Maharaj, who are we, if you don't laugh, do we have the ability to laugh?
We can't sleep anymore, sir!"

Basanta Ray said anxiously, "What are you saying,Saheb?
I am not sick at all,—I laugh at myself seeing my own condition—I am happy being by myself—what sickness do I have,Khan Saheb?"

Khan Saheb - "Your highness, we don't get to hear music and songs from you anymore."

Basanta Ray suddenly became a little serious and said, "Saheb, will you listen to my song?"

"I am the only one left."

Whatever was there is gone,

What remains is just a gap.

Khan Saheb - "You and that sitar, where is it?
Where is that sitar of yours?"

Basanta Ray said with a slight smile, "It's not that the sitar is not there.
The sitar is there, only its strings are broken, so it doesn't produce any melody."
Saying this, he looked towards the mango grove and started running his hand over his head.

After a while Basanta Ray said, Khan Saheb, sing a song—sing a song, sing—"Fresh, fresh, new, new."

Khan Saheb started singing:—

"Fresh, fresh, new, new."

Seeing this, Basanta Ray became excited—and could not sit still any longer!
He stood up, started singing along, "Fresh, fresh, new, new."
He started clapping frequently and sang repeatedly.
While singing, the sun set, it started getting dark, and the shepherds started singing as they headed home.
At that moment, Sitaram arrived and greeted him by saying, "Victory to the Maharaj."
Basanta Ray was completely startled, immediately stopped singing, hurriedly came to him, touched his body, and said, "Oh, it's Sitaram!
Are you well?
How is Dada?
Where is Didi?
Is the news good?"

Khan Saheb left.
Sitaram said, "I am reporting one by one, Maharaj."
Saying this, he told the story of the crown prince's imprisonment one by one.
Sitaram did not tell the whole truth.
He did not clearly state the reason for Udayaditya's imprisonment.

Basanta Ray felt as if the sky had fallen on his head, he held Shitaram's hand firmly.
His eyebrows rose, his eyes widened, his lips parted—he looked at Shitaram's face with unblinking eyes and said, "What?"

Sitaram said, "Yes, your highness."
After a brief pause, Basanta Ray said, "Sitaram!"

Sitaram - "Your Majesty!"

Basanta Ray - "Then where is Dada now?"

Sitaram - "Sir, he is in prison!"

Basanta Ray started running his fingers through his hair.
Udayaditya imprisoned, this news seems to be hard for him to digest, he is unable to comprehend it.
After a while he held Sitaram's hand and said, "Sitaram!"

Sitaram - "Yes, your highness!"

Basanta Ray—"Then what is Dada doing now?"

Sitaram - "What else can I do!
He is in prison."

Basanta Ray—"Has everyone kept her locked up?"

Sitaram - "Yes, your highness."

Basanta Ray—"Doesn't anyone let him out even once?"

Sitaram - "No, sir."

Basanta Ray-"Who is sitting alone in the prison?"

Basanta Ray did not ask these questions to any particular person.
He was talking to himself.
Sitaram could not understand that—he replied—“Yes, Your Majesty.”

Basanta Ray exclaimed, "Brother, come to me.
No one recognized you."

## Chapter 28

Basanta Ray started for Jashore the very next day, not paying heed to anyone's advice.
Upon reaching Jashore, he went straight to the inner chambers of the palace.
Bibha was startled to see her uncle all of a sudden.
For moments, she was unable to decide what to do.
With surprise in eyes, joy on her lips, no speech, and motionless body — she stepped back a little — then fell at feet and touched them, taking the dust of his feet on her head.
After Bibha stood up, Basanta Ray looked at Bibha's face with great concentration and asked, "Bibha?"
He didn't say anything else, just asked, "Bibha?"
It seemed as if a slight ray of hope had arisen in his mind that what Sitaram had said might not be true.
He was afraid to ask the whole thing clearly, lest Bibha answer him!
He didn't want Bibha to answer his question immediately.
So, he asked Bibha's face very fearfully — "Bibha?"
That's why he looked at face very concentratedly once.
Bibha understood and Bibha couldn't answer too.
Her initial excitement and jubilation had faded away.
She remembered the days when her uncle used to come!
What a festive occasion it was!
What a joy it brought when he came!
He used to joke and laugh, Bibha laughed but couldn't joke, Dada would listen to Uncle's songs with a serene joy.
Today, Uncle came, but no one else came to him, only Bibha stood alone in this dark world—alone like the only remaining fragment of a happy family — standing before Uncle.
The house where joyful sounds would resonate when Uncle came—why is the house of Surma so like now?
It's quiet, dark, and empty today — the house feels like it is crying upon seeing Uncle!
Basanta Ray stood in front of that room once, as if seeking assurance of something — he stood by the door and peered inside, then immediately turned his face away and asked with a burst of emotion — "Sister, is there anybody in the house?"

Bibha started crying and said, "No, granduncle, no one."

The silent room seemed to cry out, "Those who were here before, none of them are here now!"

Basanta Ray stood silently for a long time, finally holding Bibha's hand, he slowly started singing—

"I am the only one left, Rainu!"

Basanta Ray went to Pratapaditya and pleaded, "Baba Pratap, why do you torture Uday like this?
What wrong has he done to you?
If you don't love him and if he keeps making mistakes, then give him to this old man.
I will take him with me and keep him.
You won't have to see him again.
He will stay with me!"

Pratapaditya listened to Basanta Ray's words patiently for a long time, then finally said, "Uncle, whatever I have done, I have done after much deliberation—you certainly know much less about this than I do—yet you have come to give advice, I cannot accept all these words of yours."

Then Basanta Ray stood up and came to Pratapaditya, held his hands and said, "Oh son Pratap, don't you remember!
I carried you on my back and raised you when you were a child, don't you remember that?
From the day your late father handed you over to me, did I ever cause you any pain for even a moment?
When you were helpless and in my care, was there a single day when you felt fatherless?
Pratap, tell me, what wrong did I do to you that you could cause me so much pain in my old age?
I am not saying that you owe me anything because I raised you—by raising you, I was only trying to repay the debt of affection I owed your father.
Therefore, Pratap, I do not ask you for anything that I deserve, I never have.
I only beg you for something—will you not even give me that?"

Tears started to fall from Basanta Ray's eyes, Pratapaditya sat still like a statue.

Basanta Ray said again, "So you won't listen to me, you won't grant my request, Pratap?"
Sighing deeply, he said, "Alright, I have one more humble request, I want to see Uday once, I want someone to allow me to enter his prison, grant me this permission!"

Pratapaditya didn't give that too.
Seeing him showing so much affection towards Udayaditya, Pratapaditya was very upset in his mind.
The more he felt that people were trying to make him the culprit, the more adamant he became.

Basanta Ray returned to the women's quarters with a completely dejected face—Bibha felt very distressed seeing his face.
Bibha held her granduncle's hand and said—"Granduncle, come to my room."
Basanta Ray silently entered Bibha's room with Bibha.
After he sat down in the room, Bibha moved his gray hair with her soft fingers and said—"Granduncle, come, let me comb your gray hair."
Basanta Ray said, "Sister, is there any gray hair left?
When I was young, I had a lot of it, I used to ask you to comb my gray hair—today I have become old—today I don't have any gray hair anymore."

Basanta Ray saw that Bibha's face became pale, her eyes welled up with tears.
He immediately said—"Come Bibha, come.
Comb a few strands of hair.
I can't gather all your gray hair anymore, my dear.
I am getting old, I am gradually balding—now look for another head—I give up."
Saying this, Basanta Ray started laughing.

A maid came and said to Basanta Ray, "The queen mother wants to meet you once."

Basanta Ray went to his wife's room, Bibha went to prison.

The queen bowed to Basanta Ray.
Basanta Ray blessed her - "Mother, may you live long."

The queen said, "Uncle, please don't bless me anymore.
Now, I will only be saved if I die."

Basanta Ray said hurriedly, "Ram, Ram!
Don't even mention it."

The queen said, "What else can I say, uncle, it seems like Saturn's gaze has fallen upon my household."

Basanta Ray became even busier.

The queen said, "Seeing Bibha's face, I have lost my appetite.
When I ask her, she doesn't say anything, only her body is wasting away day by day.
I don't know what to do with her!"

Basanta Ray became very anxious.
"Look here, uncle, a disastrous letter has arrived."
Saying this, he handed over a letter to Basanta Ray.

As Basanta Ray was reading the letter, his wife started crying and said, "What happiness do I have?
My dear Uday doesn't know anything.
The Maharaj didn't let him become like a king, but I carried him in my womb, he is my own child.
I wonder how he is doing there, he doesn't even let me see him once!"
Whatever the queen talks about these days, Udayaditya's topic comes up at some point.
That pain is always awake in her heart, day and night.

After reading the letter, Basanta Ray was completely astounded—he sat silently and started running his hand through his hair.
After a while, Basanta Ray asked his wife, "You didn't show the letter to anyone, did you?"

The queen said, "If the king hears about this letter, will he spare us?
And will Bibha be able to survive?"

Basanta Ray said, "You did well.
Don't show this letter to anyone else, daughter-in-law.
Send Bibha to her in-laws' house soon.
Don't worry about honor and disgrace!"

The queen said, "I thought the same.
I don't care about my pride, I just want Bibha to be happy.
I'm just afraid they might neglect Bibha."

Basanta Ray said,—“You will neglect Bibha!
Is Bibha someone to be neglected!
Bibha will be cherished wherever she goes.
Where else can you find such a goddess Lakshmi, such a golden idol!
Ramchandra has written this letter only because he is angry with you, if you send her back, his anger will subside!”
Basanta Ray, with his simple heart and simple intellect, understood this.
His queen understood it too!

Basanta Ray said, "Inform the household that Ramchandra has written a letter requesting Bibha to be sent to Chandradwip.
Then Bibha will definitely not disagree to go there."

## Chapter 29

After dusk, Basanta Ray was sitting alone in the outer courtyard.
At that moment, Sitaram came and bowed to him.

Basanta Ray asked him - "What news, Sitaram?"

Sitaram said, "I will tell you later, you have to come with me."

Basanta Ray said, "Why, where is Sitaram?"

Then Sitaram came and sat nearby.
He whispered something quietly.
Basanta Ray widened his eyes and said, "Really?"

Sitaram said, "Yes, your highness."

Basanta Ray started hesitating a lot in his mind.
He said— “Do I have to go right now!”

Sitaram - "Yes, sir!"

Basanta Ray—"Shall I go and meet Bibha once?"

Sitaram - "Permission - no - no more time!"

Basanta Ray—"Where do I have to go?"

Sitaram - "Come with me, I will take you."

Basanta Ray stood up and said, "Why don't I go and meet Bibha once?"

Sitaram - "No, your highness!
If we delay, everything will be ruined!"

Basanta Ray quickly said, "Then there's nothing to do—nothing to do!"
Both of them left.

Walking some distance again, he said, "Can't we delay it a little?"

Sitaram - "No, Your Majesty, then there will be danger!"

Saying, "Durga বল", Basanta Ray left the palace.

Udayaditya did not know that Basanta Ray had come.
Bibha did not tell him.
Because when there was no possibility of their meeting, this news would have caused him pain.
After taking leave in the evening, Bibha left the prison.
Udayaditya is reading a Sanskrit book with a lamp.
The wind is coming through the window, the faint flame of the lamp is flickering, the letters are not visible properly.
Insects are coming and falling on the lamp.
The lamp is flickering every now and then.
Once the wind blew hard - the lamp went out.
Udayaditya jumped up from the book and sat on his bed.
One by one, how many thoughts came to mind.
Bibha's words came to mind.
Bibha came a little late today, she left a little early in the morning.
Today he had seen Bibha taking a special bath; - He was discussing that in his mind.
As if there is no one else in the world for him - he does not see anyone else all day except Bibha - Bibha is his only topic of discussion.
Bibha's every smile, every word is stored in his mind - just as a thirsty person enjoys every drop of his drink, so does he enjoy even the slightest sign of Bibha's love.
That is why today, lying alone in this secluded, small, dark room, he was thinking of Bibha's pale face, the idol of affection.
Sitting in that darkness, it once occurred to him - "Is Bibha gradually getting bored?
Doesn't she like to serve a depressed, dark figure in this joyless prison anymore?
Does she gradually see me as an obstacle to her happiness - a thorn in her family life?
She came late today - tomorrow she may come even later - then one day she may sit all day waiting for Bibha to come - afternoon - evening - night, Bibha did not come!
- Then maybe Bibha won't come from then on."
The more this thought came to Udayaditya's mind, the more his mind started to ache - the four sides of his imaginary kingdom started to look terribly empty.
One day will come when Bibha will look at him with eyes devoid of affection and call him a thorn in her happiness - just a glimpse of that distant imagination made his heart tremble.
Once he thought, "How terribly selfish I am!
I love Bibha so much that I am doing her a terrible disservice, I don't think even an enemy can do that."
He repeatedly vowed not to depend on Bibha again -
but whenever he imagined that he had lost Bibha, that strength would go away from his mind, then he would fall on the unfathomable stone - like a dying drowning person, he would eagerly cling to Bibha's imaginary form.

At that moment, suddenly a huge uproar arose from outside, "Fire—fire".
Udayaditya's heart started pounding—hundreds of voices rose together outside, suddenly the sound of hundreds of people's footsteps was heard in the sky along with various screams of distress.
Udayaditya realized that a fire had broken out somewhere near the palace.
The commotion continued for a long time—his mind became very restless.
Suddenly, the door of his prison was opened with great force.
Someone entered his dark room—he was startled and asked, "Who's there?"

He replied, "I am Sita Ram, please come outside."

Udayaditya said - "Why?"

Sitaram said, "Your highness, there is a fire in the prison, come out quickly!"
Saying this, he grabbed him and practically carried him out of the prison.

After many days, Udayaditya came to an open space today—he could suddenly see a lot of sky above his head, the wind seemed to spread its wide chest and embrace him.
The obstacles to his eyes were removed from all sides.
On that dark night, under the gaze of countless stars in the sky, standing on a soft grass in the middle of a vast field, suddenly an immense indescribable joy arose in his mind.
He remained silent for a while in that joy and then asked Sitaram - "What should I do, where should I go?"
He was confined to a narrow space for many days, did not walk or stroll—today he came to this vast field and helplessly asked Sitaram "What should I do?
Where should I go?"
Sitaram said - "Come, come with me!"

Meanwhile, the fire was raging fiercely.
In the afternoon, some subjects had come to the chief employees with a petition.
They were sitting together in the courtyard of the palace—they were the first to raise the alarm about the fire.
There was a long row of huts near the prison for the guards to live in—their beds, utensils, clothes, and all their belongings were kept there.
As soon as they heard about the fire, all the guards who could ran there, those who couldn't just started waving their hands and feet.
There were one or two guards at Udayaditya's residence as well, but there was no need for strict security there.
They only kept guard because it was customary.
Because Udayaditya lived in his house so peacefully that it didn't seem like he would ever try to escape or had any desire to escape.
That's why the guards at his door were the first to run away.
Night fell, the fire didn't die down—some people started moving their belongings, some started pouring water, some just started making noise without doing anything; after the fire was put out, they were the ones who received the most praise.
While everyone was busy like this, a woman suddenly ran towards them, she wanted to say something—but who would listen to her?
Some people abused her, some pushed her away—no one listened to her.
The one who did listen said, "What do I care if the prince escaped, or what do you care?
That Dayal Singh knows—I can't go anywhere now, leaving my house."

Saying this, she disappeared into the crowd.
Being thus repeatedly obstructed, the lady became furious.
She grabbed hold of the first person she could find and said, "You fool, are you blind?
Don't you know how to serve the king?
I will tell the king tomorrow and have you beaten to death.
I will not spare you.
The crown prince has run away!"

"Serves you right—what's it to you?" saying this he beat her up real good—this man was one of those who had set fire to the house.
Being beaten, that woman's appearance became very fearsome—her eyes started blazing like an angry tigress, her hair flared up; she started gnashing her teeth, the reflection of the flames fell on her face making her look like a demon.
A piece of wood was burning in front, she picked it up, her hand got burnt, but she didn't drop it, she ran after him with that burning wood.
Not being able to catch him—she threw that wood at him.

## Chapter 30

Sitaram took the prince along to the bank of the canal; there was a large boat tied there, and both of them went and stood in front of the boat.
Seeing them, a person hurriedly came out of the boat and said, "Brother, have you come?"
Udayaditya was completely startled—that ever-familiar voice, the voice that was intertwined with the memories of his childhood, with the happiness and sorrows of his youth—the voice with which all the happiness and joy in the world was inseparable!
The voice that he would suddenly hear in his sleep like the sound of a flute on sleepless nights in the prison, and he would wake up startled—that voice!
Before he could recover from his astonishment, Basanta Ray came and embraced him.
Both of their eyes filled with tears.
Both of them sat down on the grass there.
After a long time, Udayaditya said, "Brother!"
Basanta Ray said, "What, brother!"
They didn't say anything else.
After a long time again, Udayaditya looked around, looked up at the sky, looked at Basanta Ray's face, and said in an anguished voice, "Brother, today I have got freedom,—I have got you, what more happiness is left for me?
How long will this moment last?"
After a while, Sitaram folded his hands and said, "Your Highness, please get on the boat."

The crown prince, startled, said - "Why, why in a boat?"

Sitaram said - "Otherwise the guards will come again right now."

Udayaditya asked Basanta Ray in surprise, "Uncle, are we running away?"

Basanta RayheldUdayaditya'shandandsaid,"Yesbrother,Iamtakingyoustealingaway!Thisisacountryofstone-heartedpeople—theydo not love you!
You are a deer-child living in the kingdom of these hunters—I will hide you in the core of my heart, where you will be safe!"
Saying this, he pulled Udayaditya close to his chest—as if he wanted to snatch him away from the harsh world and keep him confined in the kingdom of love.

Udayaditya thought for a long time and said, "No, granduncle, I cannot run away."

Basanta Ray said, "Why brother, have you forgotten this old man?"

Udayaditya said, "I'm going—I'll go and touch my father's feet and beg him, maybe he'll agree to go to Raigarh."

Basanta Ray became restless and said, "Brother, listen to me— Don't go there, that effort will be futile."

Udayaditya sighed and said, "Then I'll go—I'll return to prison."

Basanta Ray held his hand and said, "How will you go, let me see.
I will not let you go."

Udayaditya said, "Granduncle, why are you inviting danger by taking this unfortunate man with you?
Is there any chance of peace wherever I am?"

Basanta Ray said, "Oh brother, Bibha has also become a prisoner because of you.
Will she sacrifice all the happiness of her young life?"
Tears started flowing from Basanta Ray's eyes.

Then Udayaditya said hurriedly, "Then come on, let's go, granduncle."
He looked at Sitaram and said, "Sitaram, I want to send three letters to the palace."

Sitaram said - "There is pen and paper in the boat, I'll bring it.
Write quickly, there is not much time."

Udayaditya begged for forgiveness from his father.
He wrote to his mother, "Mother, you could never be happy after conceiving me.
This time, be worry-free, mother—I am going to my granduncle, I will be happy there, I will be loved there, you will have no reason to worry."
He wrote to Bibha, "Long live, my dear—what else can I write to you—may you be happy for lives to come—may you go to your husband's house and establish a happy family, forgetting all your sorrows and troubles!"
As he wrote, Udayaditya's eyes filled with tears.
Sitaram sent those three letters to the palace through a palanquin bearer.
Everyone was getting on the boat—at that moment they saw someone running towards them.
Sitaram exclaimed in surprise, "Oh—that witch is coming!"
In no time, Rukmini reached them.
Her hair was disheveled—her veil had fallen off, her eyes like burning coals were emitting fire—impatient with the pain of her repeatedly thwarted desires, her unfulfilled vengeful tendencies, she seemed to want to tear apart and kill anyone she came across to appease her anger!
She had repeatedly tried to enter Pratapaditya's room, only to be pushed back by the guards trying to put out the fire, and was driven away by the guards who thought she was mad.
Disturbed by the pain, she ran out of the palace.
Like a tigress, she tried to pounce on Udayaditya.
Sitaram came in between—she lunged at Sitaram with a scream, and grabbed him with both hands with all her might—suddenly Sitaram screamed, the palanquin bearers rushed in and forcibly pulled Rukmini away.
Like a suicidal scorpion stinging itself all over, she scratched her chest and pulled her hair impatiently, screaming, "Nothing happened, nothing happened—now I am dead, the sin of killing this woman will be yours."
In that dark night, this curse echoed all around.
In an instant, Rukmini jumped into the water with the speed of lightning.
The water in the canal had risen a lot during the monsoon—it was impossible to tell where she had drowned.
Blood was oozing out of Sitaram's shoulder, he tied a wet cloth around it.
He went near and saw that Udayaditya's forehead was covered in beads of sweat, his hands and feet had become cold, he had almost fainted—Basanta Ray also seemed to have lost his way and was stunned; the palanquin bearers lifted both of them and put them on the boat and immediately set sail.
Sitaram said fearfully, "What a bad omen at the start of the journey!"

## Chapter 31

When Udayaditya's boat crossed the canal and reached the river, then Sitaram got off the boat and returned to the city.
While leaving, he asked the prince for his sword.

Udayaditya had sent three letters through a man to the Sitārām Palace, but he had secretly and specifically forbidden him to hand those letters over to anyone.
Upon returning to the palace from the boat, Sītārām took those letters back.
He kept only the letters for his wife and Bibha, and destroyed the rest.

By then, the fire had spread even more.
Many people had gathered to watch the spectacle, getting out of their beds at night.
This was causing hindrance in extinguishing the fire, rather than helping.

It goes without saying that Sitaram was behind this fire.
He accomplished this feat with the help of some subjects and palace servants who were devoted to Udayaditya.
When a fire broke out in five or six houses at dusk for no reason, it was not an act of God.
There is a reason why the fire is still raging despite all the efforts to put it out.
Among those who have joined to put out the fire, there are one or two of Sitaram's men.
They pour water where there is no fire, they do not bring water when they go to fetch it, they cleverly break the pitchers, they create a commotion and blame each other.
The fire will not be contained.

Meanwhile, while all this commotion was going on, Sitaram's men set fire to Udayaditya's empty prison.
One by one, the windows, doors, bolts, bars, door frames, wooden fences, etc. caught fire.
It was beyond everyone's wildest dreams that fire could start in that prison, so no one paid any attention to it.
When Sitaram returned, he saw that the fire had taken hold quite nicely.
Sitaram somehow threw some bones, a skull, and Udayaditya's sword into Udayaditya's room.

Meanwhile, those who were extinguishing the fire in the guardhouse suddenly heard a scream from the direction of the prison.
Everyone was startled and exclaimed in unison, "What was that?"
One of them ran over and said, "Oh, the crown prince's room is on fire!"
The guards' blood ran cold, and Dayal Singh's head started spinning.
The pot fell from his hand, and he dropped the things on the ground.
Just then, another person came running from that direction and said, "The crown prince was heard screaming from inside the prison!"
Before he could finish his sentence, Sitaram came running and said, "Hey, come quickly!
The roof of the crown prince's room has collapsed, and we can't hear him anymore."
Everyone rushed towards the crown prince's prison.
When they arrived, they saw that the house had collapsed, there was fire all around, and there was no way to enter the room.
Then, standing there, they began to blame each other.
Everyone tried to determine whose carelessness had caused this incident.
A heated argument broke out, they started hurling abuses at each other, and it even came to the point of a physical fight.

Sitaram thought, the crown prince died in the house fire, I can inform the state about this news and stay carefree for some days.
When he saw that the fire had caught the house properly, he tied a sheet around his head and happily started walking towards his hut; he had come quite far from the palace.
It was very late at night, there was no one on the road, everything was quiet around him - the leaves of the bamboo trees were rustling as the south wind blew occasionally; Sitaram's happy soul was elated, he started singing a melodious song.
The lonely traveler walked on the deserted and quiet road, singing happily to his heart's content.
After walking some distance, a thought came to his mind.
He thought, I will have to flee from Jashore with my family, why not make some quick money without any effort.
Mangala the ill-fated is dead - good riddance - I should visit her house once - her daughter has a lot of money - she has no one in her family - if I don't take that money, someone else will - what's the harm in trying once!
Thinking like this, Sitaram started walking towards Rukmini's house - he started singing again in high spirits.
While walking, he saw a woman going to meet her lover on the way.
Nothing like this could escape Sitaram's eyes.
He felt an irresistible urge to crack a couple of jokes - but seeing that he didn't have the time, he suppressed the urge and walked on quickly.

Sitaram went near Rukmini's hut and saw that the door was open.
He happily entered the hut and looked around.
It was pitch dark, he couldn't see anything.
He felt around for a while.
He stumbled upon a trunk and fell, hitting his head on the wall a couple of times.
Sitaram's body started trembling.
He felt like someone was in the room.
He could hear someone's breath—he slowly went to the next room.
He saw light coming from Rukmini's bedroom.
Sitaram was overjoyed to see that the lamp was still lit.
He quickly went towards that room.
Who's that!
Who's sitting in the room!
A woman was sitting silently with her eyes open, shivering.
She was wrapped in wet clothes, her hair was disheveled and dripping with water.
Her teeth were chattering as she shivered.
There was only one lamp lit in the room.
The dim light of the lamp fell on her pale face—behind her, a very large shadow of the woman fell on the wall.
There was nothing else in the room—just that pale face—that long shadow and a terrible silence!
Sitaram's body froze as he entered the room.
He saw Mangala sitting there in the dim light, with disheveled hair and wet clothes.
At first glance, she looked like a ghost.
Sitaram didn't have the courage to move forward—he couldn't even turn back and run away!
Sitaram wasn't a coward; he stood there for a while and finally said in a mocking tone, "Where did you come from!
Hey witch, aren't you ever going to die!"
Rukmini looked at Sitaram's face for a while—Sitaram's heart started pounding in his chest.
Finally, Rukmini suddenly said, "Wow!
You're still not destroyed; and I'm going to die!"
She stood up and waved her hand, "I came back from the gates of hell!
First, I'll put you and the prince in the oven, then I'll take two handfuls of ash from the oven and smear it on my body to make my life meaningful—then I'll satisfy Yama—I have no place in hell before that."

Upon hearing Rukmini's voice, Sitaram became very emboldened.
He suddenly tried to show great affection and intimacy with Rukmini.
Not only did he move very close to her, but he also came relatively closer and said in a soft voice, "My dear, is that why you are angry?
I can never quite understand what goes on in your mind!
Tell me, Mangala, what have I done to you?
Why are you so displeased with your subordinate?
Are you sulking, my dear?
Shall I sing that song?"

The more Sitārām feigned affection, the more Rukmiṇī swelled with rage—her whole body burned with anger—if Sitārām had been the hair on her own head, she could have torn it out in handfuls, if Sitārām had been her own eyes, she could have immediately gouged them out with her nails and crushed them underfoot.
She looked around, but found nothing within reach!
Gritting her teeth, she said, “Just you wait; I’ll make your head spin,” and trembling violently, she went to the next room in search of an axe.
It was only a short while ago that Sitārām had proposed dying by tying a noose around his neck and wearing makeup, but seeing Rukmiṇī’s face, his act fell flat, and he realized that he was not yet ready to die from the blow of a real axe—for this reason, he took advantage of the opportunity and immediately slipped out of the hut.
Rukmiṇī came to the empty room with the axe in her hand and struck the floor repeatedly in Sitārām’s direction.

Rukmini has now become "crazy".
The Crown Prince's behavior has shattered her wild hopes all at once—all her means and all her objectives have been destroyed in an instant.
Now Rukmini no longer has that sharp, pointed laughter, those lightning-like piercing glances, that overflowing wave-like surge of the Bhadra month's Jahnavi—all the servants of the palace who used to come to her, she has quarreled with them, abused them and driven them away.
The Dewanji's eldest son had come to joke with her that day while chewing betel leaf, Rukmini chased him away with a broom.
Now no one dares to come near her.
Everyone in the neighborhood is afraid of her.

After leaving Sita Ram's cottage, he thought - Mangala must have known the whole story of the prince's escape.
So everything will be revealed through her - why didn't I strangle and kill that wicked woman!
Whatever - it is not good for me to stay in Jashore for a moment.
I'll leave right now.
That very night, Sita Ram and his family left Jashore and fled to Raigarh.

Towards the end of the night, the clouds gathered and a torrential rain began—the fire also gradually died down.
The news of the crown prince's death reached Pratapaditya's ears.
Upon hearing it, Pratapaditya immediately came out and sat in his council chamber.
He summoned the guards, the minister and one or two other members of the council.
One of them testified that he had seen the crown prince through the window when the fire was raging fiercely.
A few others said that they had heard the crown prince's screams.
Another one brought the remains of his melted and burnt sword from the crown prince's residence.
Pratapaditya asked, "Where is my uncle?"
They searched the palace but could not find him.
Someone said, "He was also in prison when the fire broke out."
Someone else said, "No, he got the news at night that the crown prince had died in the fire and upon hearing that, he immediately left Jashore."
While Pratapaditya was sitting in the council chamber listening to everyone's testimonies, there was a commotion at the entrance.
A woman was trying to enter the room, but the guards were stopping her.
Upon hearing this, Pratapaditya ordered them to let her in.
A guard brought Rukmini inside.
The king asked her, "What do you want?"
She waved her hands and said in a loud voice, "I don't want anything else—I want to see you make all these guards rot in jail for six months, one by one, and feed them with gruel.
Do they respect you or fear you?"
Hearing this, the guards started making noise from all sides.
Rukmini turned around, rolled her eyes and shouted sternly, "Shut up, you fools.
Yesterday, when I caught hold of you and cried out—Hey, your crown prince is running away with the old king of Raigarh—why didn't you wretched people listen to me?
You have become very arrogant working in the king's palace, you think you have seen the fifth leg of a snake!
May you die with the wings of an ant!"

Pratapaditya said, "Tell me everything that happened."

Rukmini said, "What else can I say!
Your crown prince eloped with the old king last night."

Pratapaditya asked, "Do you know who set fire to the house?"

Rukmini said, "I don't know anything else!
That Sitaram of yours.
He is so devoted to your crown prince—as if he has no one else in the world, as if Sitaram is his everything.
All this is Sitaram's doing.
The old king, Sitaram, and your crown prince, these three have conspired and done this—I am telling you this clearly!"

Pratapaditya remained silent for a long time!
He asked, "How did you come to know all this?"
Rukmini said, "What's the use of talking about it!
Give me some men, I myself will go and find them and bring them out.
Your palace servants are all sheep—they won't do this job."

Pratapaditya ordered to give people along with Rukmini and ordered the guards to give appropriate punishment.
The assembly hall became empty one by one.
Only the minister and the emperor remained.
The minister thought that the emperor would definitely say something to him.
But Pratapaditya did not say anything, he remained seated in silence.
The minister once said in a very slow voice with the intention of saying something, "Your Majesty!"
The emperor did not respond to him.
The minister got up slowly and left.

That very day before dusk, Pratapaditya got the news of Udayaditya's escape from a fisherman.
He had seen Udayaditya sailing away on a boat down the river.
Gradually, he started getting news from various other people.
The people who had gone with Rukmini returned after a week and said, "We saw the prince in Raigarh."
The king asked, "Where is that woman?"
They said, "She didn't come back, she stayed there."

Then Pratapaditya called one of his Pathan generals named Muktiyar Khan and secretly gave him some orders.
He saluted and left.

## Chapter 32

Before Pratapaditya, his queen and Bibha came to know about Udayaditya's escape.
Both of them were overwhelmed with fear and were thinking about what the king would do when he would come to know about it.
Every day, as the king was getting news one after another, the anxiety of both of them was increasing.
In this way, a week passed and finally, the king got reliable and true news.
But he did nothing.
He did not show even a hint of anger.
Unable to bear the suspense any longer, the queen went to Pratapaditya once.
But for a long time, she did not dare to ask anything about Udayaditya.
The king also did not bring up the topic.
Finally, unable to hold back any longer, the queen said, "Maharaj, please grant me one wish, forgive Uday this time!
If you torture him any more, I will eat poison and die!"

Pratapaditya said with a hint of annoyance, "Why are you starting to cry now!
I haven't done anything!"

Lest Pratapaditya suddenly turns back, for this reason, the queen did not dare to raise the topic of the buffalo a second time.
She walked slowly with a fearful mind.
One day, two days, three days passed, no change in the mood of the Maharaja was noticed.
Seeing this, the queen and Bibha were relieved!
They thought that the Maharaja was probably happy in his mind because Udayaditya had been transferred.

Now for a few days, the queen could be somewhat relieved.

Earlier, the queen had told Bibha and had instructed her about the household, that Ramchandra Ray had written a letter requesting that Bibha be sent to her in-laws' house.
Bibha's joy knew no bounds.
Ever since she had bid farewell to Rammohan, Bibha had not had a moment's peace.
Whenever she found some free time, she would think, "What must he be thinking?
Does he understand my situation?
Or is he angry?
If I explain things to him, will he not forgive me?
Oh, Jagadishwar, when will I be able to explain things to him?
When will I see him again?"
Bibha would constantly think about these things over and over again.
A fear had been weighing heavily on her mind since nightfall.
When Bibha heard the queen's words, she was overjoyed, and a terrible burden was instantly lifted from her mind.
She threw away her shame and embarrassment, and with a mixture of laughter and tears, she hid her face in her mother's bosom and remained silent for a long time.
Her mother began to cry.
When Bibha realized that her husband had not misunderstood her, that he had understood her feelings exactly, the whole world seemed like a beautiful garden to her.
She felt that her husband's heart was so broad.
She developed so much faith and trust in her husband's love!
She felt that her husband's love was her unwavering support in this world.
She felt like a delicate creeper that had wrapped its arms around the broad shoulders of a strong man, relying on him with unwavering faith, and that she would never be separated from this support.
Bibha became cheerful.
Her soul expanded and became clear, like the sky on a cloudy autumn day.
Now she would play like a child with her brother Samaraditya.
She would make demands of her mother like a loving little girl, and she would help her mother with the household chores.
The silent, gloomy shadow that had once been her demeanor had disappeared—now her cheerful heart blossomed all over her body like a bright morning.
The hesitation, the shyness, the sadness, the pride, the silence of the past were gone.
Now she would happily and trustingly talk to her mother about so many things that she would have been too embarrassed to talk about before.
Seeing her daughter's joy, the mother's immense love welled up.
A thought was stirring deep inside her, but she never let even a hint of it show in front of Bibha.
How could she, as a mother, tarnish even a bit of Bibha's pure, peaceful smile?
That is why the girl laughed and played in front of her eyes every day, and the mother watched her with a smile on her face and insatiable eyes.

The queen had a fear, a doubt in her mind, that is why she could not send Bibha to her in-laws' house for so long.
Two or three weeks passed, everyone was somewhat relieved about Udayaditya.
However, the queen could not decide what to do about Bibha.
A few more days passed.
The more the delay, the more impatient Bibha became.
Bibha thought that the more the delay, the more she was becoming a sinner in the eyes of her husband.
When he had called her, why the delay!
He had forgiven her once, again—. Bibha did not say anything for a few days—finally one day she could not hold back; she went to her mother, held her mother's neck, looked at her mother's face and said, "Mother."
Her mother understood everything with just those words, she pulled Bibha to her chest and said, "What, my child!"
Bibha remained silent for a while and finally said, "Mother, when will you send me, mother!"
Saying this, Bibha's face and ears turned red.
Her mother smiled slightly and asked, "Where should I send you, Bibhu!"
Bibha said in a pleading voice, "Don't say, mother."
The queen said, "Be patient for a few more days, my child.
I will send you soon."
Saying this, tears came to her eyes.

## Chapter 33

After many days, Udayaditya came to Raigarh, but he did not find the same joy as before.
There was a thought weighing on his mind, so he did not enjoy anything.
He was thinking, what will happen to him for the deed that his granduncle has done, he does not think that his father will let him go easily.
Why was I born in such an unlucky time!
He went to Basanta Ray and said, "Granduncle, I am leaving, I am going back to Jashore."
At first, Basanta Ray tried to brush off his words with songs and laughter; he sang—

I will not leave you!

Even if I don't get my heart's desire

I will keep it by force.

If I steal away life, emptying the city of the heart

You stay there then

Filling the empty heart.

Finally, when Udayaditya said it again and again, Basanta Ray was hurt.
He stopped singing and said with a sad face, "Why brother, what is wrong with you when I am here?"
Udayaditya could not say anything more.

Seeing Udayaditya depressed, Basanta Ray tried his best day and night to make him happy.
He would play the sitar, take him out for walks—almost all of Basanta Ray's official duties were neglected because of Udayaditya.
Basanta Ray was afraid that he might not be able to keep Udayaditya with him, that Udayaditya might go back to Jashore.
He kept a close watch on him day and night, and said to him, "Dada, I won't let you go to that land of stone-hearted people again."

After a few days, Udayaditya's mind became somewhat relaxed.
After gaining freedom after a long time, he was living in the soft heart of Basanta Ray, in his immense affection, freed from the narrow, stone-built prison-like four walls.
After a long time, he was seeing trees and plants all around, seeing the sky, seeing the open dawn light spread far and wide, listening to the songs of birds, feeling the wind blowing all over his body from a distant horizon, seeing stars all over the sky at night, immersed in the stream of moonlight, living in the life of sleeping silence.
He could go wherever he wanted, do whatever he wanted, there was no more hindrance in anything.
The subjects who knew Udayaditya since his childhood came from far and wide to see him.
Gangadhar came, Fatik came, Habichacha and Karimullah came, Mathur came with his three sons, Paran and Hari, the two brothers came, Shital Sardar came with five lathials to show the game.
Every day the subjects started coming to the prince.
The prince asked them many questions.
The subjects were very happy and surprised to see that Udayaditya had not forgotten them yet.
Mathur said, "Maharaj, my son was born in the month you came to Raigarh, you had seen him, after that two more children were born to me with your blessings."
Saying this, he brought his three sons to the prince and said, "Pay obeisance."
They bowed down and paid obeisance.
Paran came and said, "Maharaj!
I was the boatman in the boat in which Your Highness went to Jashore from here."
Shital Sardar came and said, "Maharaj, when you were in Raigarh, you had given me a tip after seeing my lathi game, today I wish to show my sons' game to Maharaj.
Come on, Bapdhan, you guys move forward."
Saying this, he called the boys.
In this way, every day in the morning, the subjects would come to Udayaditya in groups and talk together.

Amidst such affection, amidst trees and plants, amidst joy, amidst the exuberance of songs, Udayaditya's mind naturally felt somewhat relaxed from worries.
He closed his eyes and thought, perhaps his father is not angry, perhaps he is pleased, otherwise why would he not have done anything for so long!

But he could not keep his mind deluded with such blind faith for long.
He started feeling a kind of fear for his grandfather.
It was useless to tell his grandfather about returning to Jashore; he decided that he would run away to Jashore one day in secret.
Then he remembered that prison again.
Where was this joyful freedom, and where was that monotonous life of that small, narrow prison!
Every moment of that prison started appearing like a year.
He could clearly see that isolated, deserted, airless, closed room in his imagination, and his body shivered.
Yet he decided that he had to run away from here towards that prison one day.
He could not think of running away today—“I will run away one day,” thinking this, he felt somewhat relieved.

Today is Thursday, the day of the weekly market, so the journey cannot start today, it will be tomorrow.
Today is a very bad day.
It has been drizzling since morning.
The entire sky is covered with clouds.
Udayaditya has decided that he must leave Raigarh by evening today.
When he met Basanta Ray in the morning, Basanta Ray hugged Udayaditya and said, "Brother, I had a terrible nightmare last night.
I don't remember the dream properly, but I remember that it felt like I was being separated from you... like forever."

Udayaditya held Basanta Ray's hand and said, "No, granduncle!—
If there has to be a separation, why should it be like a separation for life?"

Basanta Ray looked in another direction and said in a thoughtful tone, "What else could it be!
How long more will I live, I have grown old!"

The last strains of the nightmare of the previous night were still echoing in Basanta Ray's mind, so he was absent-mindedly lost in thought.

Udayaditya remained silent for a while and then said, "Granduncle, what if we get separated again!"

Basanta Ray caught hold of Udayaditya's neck and said, "Why, my boy, why should we be separated?
Don't leave me.
Don't abandon me in my old age, my boy!"

Tears came to Udayaditya's eyes.
He was surprised;—how did Basanta Ray come to know his mind's intention.
Sighing, he said, "If I stay close, then you will be in danger, granduncle!"

Basanta Ray laughed and said, "What danger, brother?
Do I fear any more danger at this age!
There is no greater danger than death!
Well, death is my neighbor; it constantly sends to inquire about me, but I don't fear it.
What if a person who has overcome all the obstacles of life and lived to old age, his boat overturns just as he arrives at the shore?"

Udayaditya spent the whole day with Basanta Ray today.
It started raining lightly all day long.

In the afternoon, it started raining, Udayaditya got up.
Basanta Ray said - "Brother, where are you going!"

Udayaditya said - "Let's go out for a walk!"

Basanta Ray said - "You didn't go today."

Udayaditya said - "Why, granduncle?"

Basanta Ray: Embracing Udayaditya, said, "Today you will not go out of the house, today you will stay with me, brother!"

Udayaditya said, "I won't go far, granduncle, I'll be right back."
Saying this, he went outside.

As soon as he reached the outer gate of the palace, a guard said, "Maharaj, shall I accompany you?"

The crown prince said - "No, it is not necessary."

The guard said—"The Maharaj has no weapon in his hand!"

The crown prince said - "What is the need for weapons?"

Udayaditya went outside the palace.
There was a long, vast field, he went and stood in the middle of that field.
He started walking alone.
Gradually, the light of the day started to fade.
Many thoughts came to his mind.
The crown prince started thinking about his aimless and purposeless life.
He realized that nothing in his life was certain, he had no stability—he didn't know what would happen the next moment.
He was young, he still had a lot of life left—how would he spend this vast future without building a home or finding a permanent shelter?
Then he remembered—Bibha.
Where is Bibha now?
For so long, I was the one who was blocking her happiness—is she happy now?
He silently blessed Bibha many times in his mind.

In the middle of the field, there is a forest of Ashoka, Banyan, Date Palm, Betel Nut, etc. for the cowherds to sit in the sun—the prince entered it.
By then, dusk had fallen.
It was getting dark.
The prince was supposed to escape today—he was mentally disturbed thinking about that decision.
When Basanta Ray hears that Udayaditya has escaped, what will be his condition—how will he be heartbroken and say with a sorrowful face—“Oh.
Dada, he escaped from me!”
He could almost see that scene clearly.—

At that moment, a woman exclaimed in a harsh voice, "Here is the tree, here is your crown prince—right here!"

Two soldiers holding torches came and stood near the prince.
In no time, many more came and surrounded him.
Then that woman came near him and said, "Can you recognize me?
Look this way once!
Look this way once."
The prince saw in the light of the torch, Rukmini.
Seeing Rukmini's behavior, the soldiers threatened her and said, "Get away, witch!"
She didn't pay any attention to that and started saying—"Who did all this?
I did it.
Who did all this?
I did it.
Who brought all these soldiers here?
I brought them.
I did so much for you, and you—the prince turned his back on Rukmini in disgust and stood!"
The soldiers forcibly caught Rukmini and took her away.
Then Muktiyar Khan came forward and stood saluting the prince.
The prince said in surprise—"Muktiyar Khan, what's the news?"

Muktiyar Khan humbly said, "Sir, I am coming after taking orders from our Maharaj!"

The crown prince asked, "What is your command!"

Muktiyar Khan took out Pratapaditya's signed order and handed it over to the crown prince.

The prince said after reading, "Why is there a need for so many soldiers for this?
If you had written me a letter and ordered me, I would have gone!
I was about to go myself, I had decided to go.
Then why this delay?
Let's go now.
Let's return to Jashore now."
Muktiyar Khan folded his hands and said, "I can't return now."

The crown prince, frightened, asked, "Why?"
Muktiyar Khan said, "There is another order, which I cannot leave without obeying."

The crown prince said in a frightened voice, "What is your command!"

Muktiyar Khan said, "The Maharaja has ordered the execution of the king of Raigarh."

The crown prince exclaimed in surprise and said in a loud voice - "No, I didn't do it, it's a lie!"

Muktiyar Khan said, "Your Highness, it is not false.
I have a letter signed by the Maharaj."

The crown prince held the Senapati's hand and said anxiously, "Muktiyar Khan, you have misunderstood.
The Maharaja has ordered that if Udayaditya is not found, then Basanta Ray—since I am surrendering myself, what more!
Take me away right now, take me away right now—arrest me and take me away, don't delay any further!"

Muktiyar Khan said, "Your Highness, I am not mistaken.
The Maharaj has given clear orders."

The crown prince said impatiently, "You must have misunderstood.
That was not his intention.
Alright, come, let's go to Jashore.
I will explain to the Maharaja in front of you, if he orders a second time, then carry out the order!"

Muktiyar said with folded hands, "Your highness, please forgive me, I cannot do that!"

The crown prince said, getting more impatient, "Muktiyar, remember, I will ascend to the throne one day.
Keep your promise and satisfy me!"

The steward stood silently without replying.

The crown prince's face turned pale, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead.
He held the commander's hand firmly and said, "Muktiyar Khan, killing an old, innocent, and virtuous man will not give you a place even in hell!"

Muktiyar Khan said, "There is no sin in carrying out the master's orders."

Udayaditya exclaimed in a loud voice, "Falsehood.
The religious scripture that says so is false.
Know for sure, Muktiyar, following a sinful order is a sin."

The steward stood silently without replying.

Udayaditya looked around and exclaimed, "Then let me go.
I will return to the fort.
Take your soldiers and feudatories and go there—I challenge you to a war.
Win the battle there and then carry out your orders!"

Muktiyar stood silently.
The soldiers came closer and surrounded the prince.
The prince, seeing no other way, shouted loudly in the darkness, "Uncle, beware!"
The forest trembled—and the sound echoed at the edge of the field.
The soldiers came and caught Udayaditya.
Udayaditya shouted once more—"Uncle, beware!"
A traveler was walking through the field—hearing the sound, he came closer and said, "Who's there?"
Udayaditya hurriedly said—"Go, go—run to the fort—warn the king," In the blink of an eye, the soldiers arrested the traveler.
Whoever was walking through that field—the soldiers immediately took them prisoner.

A few soldiers kept Udayaditya captive, while Muktiyar Khan and the remaining soldiers disguised themselves as ordinary people, hid their weapons, and headed towards the fort.
Raigarh had more than a hundred gates, and they entered the fort through different gates.

At that time, in the evening, Basanta Ray was sitting and performing his daily rituals.
On the other side, in the palace's prayer room, the bell for the evening prayers was ringing.
There was no commotion in the vast palace; everything was quiet.
According to Basanta Ray's rules, most of the servants got a short break in the evening.

While performing his daily rituals, Basanta Ray suddenly saw Muktiyar Khan entering his room.
He became anxious and exclaimed, "Khan Saheb, don't enter this room.
I'll finish my rituals and come out in a moment."

Muktiyar Khan went outside the room and stood near the door.
Basanta Ray quickly came out after finishing his daily prayers and touched Muktiyar Khan's shoulder, asking, "Khan Saheb, are you alright?"

The steward greeted him and said briefly, "Yes, Your Highness!"

Basanta Ray said - "Have you eaten?"

Muktiyar - "Yes, sir."

Basanta Ray — "Then, today, I will make arrangements for your stay here."

The steward said, "No need, sir.
I have to leave as soon as the work is done!"

Basanta Ray—"No, that won't do Khan Saheb, I won't let you go today, you'll have to stay here today."

Muktiyar - "No, Your Highness, you have to leave soon."

Basanta Ray asked, "Why, tell me?
Is there some special work?
Is Pratap well?"

Muktiyar - "Your Majesty is well."

Basanta Ray - "So, what is your work, tell me quickly.
I am getting worried after hearing that it is very urgent.
I hope nothing bad has happened to Pratap."

Muktiyar - "No, sir, no harm has come to him.
I have come to carry out an order of the Maharaja!"

Basanta Ray asked hurriedly, "What is your order—tell me now!"

Muktiyar Khan issued an order and handed it over to Basanta Ray.
Basanta Ray took it near the light and started reading.
In the meantime, all the soldiers gradually came near the door and stood encircling them.

After finishing reading, Basanta Ray slowly came near Muktiyar Khan and asked, "Is this Pratap's writing?"

The steward said, "Yes."

Basanta Ray asked again, "Khan Saheb, is this written by Pratap himself?"

The steward said - "Yes, Your Highness!"

Then Basanta Ray started crying and said, "Khan Saheb, I raised Pratap with my own hands!"

He remained silent for a while—finally he said again, "When Pratap was this little, I used to hold him in my lap day and night—he didn't want to leave me for a moment!
That Pratap grew up, I got him married, I put him on the throne—I took his children in my lap—that Pratap has written this letter with his own hand today, Khan Saheb?"

Tears welled up in Muktiyar Khan's eyes, he stood there with his head bowed, silent.

Basanta Ray asked, "Where is Dada?
Where is Uday?"

Muktiyar Khan said, "He has been arrested—and sent to the Maharaj for trial."

Basanta Ray exclaimed, "Uday has been captured?
Khan Saheb has been captured?
Can I see him just once?"

With folded hands, Muktiyar Khan said, "No sir, there is no order!"

Basanta Ray held Muktiyar Khan's hand with tearful eyes and said - "Won't you let me see her once, Khan Saheb!"

The steward said, "I am just a servant who follows orders."

Basanta Ray sighed deeply and said, "No one in this world has shown mercy, yes sir, I will follow your orders."

The steward then touched the ground with his forehead in salutation and said with folded hands, "Your Majesty, please forgive me—I am only following my master's orders, I am not at fault."

Basanta Ray said—"No Sahib, what is your fault?
You have no fault.
Shall I forgive you again?"
Saying this, he went to Muktiyar Khan and embraced him—said, "Tell Pratap, I died blessing him.
And see Khan Sahib, at the time of my death, I have left Uday in your care, he is innocent—see that he does not suffer anymore due to injustice."

Saying this, Basanta Ray closed his eyes and prostrated himself before his chosen deity, and started chanting the rosary with his right hand—and said, "Saheb, now!"

Muktiyar Khan called out, "Abdul."
Abdul came with a drawn sword in his hand.
Muktiyar turned his face away and moved aside.
A moment later, Abdul came out of the house with a bloodstained sword in his hand - a stream of blood began to flow in the house!

## Chapter 34

Muktiyar Khan returned.
Leaving most of the soldiers at Raigarh, he immediately set off for Jashore with Udayaditya.
On the way, for two days Udayaditya did not touch any food—did not speak a single word with anyone—just sat silently and thought.
Still as a statue—no sleep in his eyes, no blinking, no tears, no sight—just thinking.
He boarded the boat—leaning out of the boat, he kept looking at the water, the boat started moving—he could hear the sound of the oars, the sound of the water entered his ears, yet he heard nothing, saw nothing, just kept thinking.
Night fell, stars appeared in the sky, the boatmen tied up the boat, everyone on the boat slept, only the sound of the water could be heard, small waves hitting the boat—the prince, staring straight ahead—looking at the distant stretch of white sandbar, just kept thinking.
At dawn, the boatmen woke up—untied the boat—the morning breeze blew—the east turned red, the prince kept thinking.
On the third day, the prince's two eyes filled with tears and he started crying bitterly—he kept looking at the water with his head in his hands—looking at the sky.
The boat started moving—the trees and plants on the shore started moving like clouds over his eyes, tears started flowing from his eyes in a thousand streams.
After a long time, finding an opportunity, Muktiyar Khan came and sat near the prince with a pained heart, and asked politely, "Prince, what are you thinking?"
The prince was startled—for a long time he looked at Muktiyar's face in amazement.
Seeing the affection on Muktiyar's face, the prince suddenly opened his choked heart and said, "I am thinking, what have I done by being born on this earth.
Has everything been destroyed because of me!
O God, why are the weak born on this earth?
Those who cannot stand in the world on their own strength—those who cling to others at every step—what good do they do to the world?
They drown the one they hold on to, hinder all the work of the world—they themselves cannot stand, and they burden everyone else.—I am a weak coward, God saved me, and those who were the joy of the world, the hope of the world—he destroyed them because of me?
No more, I bid farewell to this world."

Udayaditya was brought before Pratapaditya as a captive.
Pratapaditya took him to a room in the inner palace and closed the door.
As soon as he came before Pratapaditya, Udayaditya's body seemed to shudder, his whole body's flesh seemed to shrink with irresistible hatred - he could not look at his father's face anymore!

Pratapaditya said in a grave voice, "What punishment is suitable for you?"

Udayaditya calmly said, "Whatever you command."

Pratapaditya said - "You are not worthy of my kingdom."

Udayaditya said, "No, Maharaj, I am not worthy.
I do not want your kingdom—relieve me from your throne—this is my request."

Pratapaditya also wanted the same, he said - "How do I know that what you are saying is truly what you feel in your heart?"

Udayaditya said, "I was born with weakness, but till today I have never told a lie for my own benefit.
If you believe me, today I will swear by touching the feet of Goddess Kali—I will never rule even a needle's tip of your kingdom—Samaraditya is the heir to your kingdom."

Pratapaditya said with satisfaction, "Then what do you want?"

Udayaditya said, "Maharaj, I don't want anything else—just don't keep me locked up like a caged animal under guard!
Abandon me, I'll leave for Kashi right now.
One more request—give me some money—I'll establish a guest house and a temple there in the name of Dadamoshai."

Pratapaditya said - "Alright, I accept that."

That very day, Udayaditya went to the temple and swore in front of Pratapaditya, saying, "Mother Kali, you are my witness.
I swear by touching your feet that as long as I live, I will not claim even an inch of the kingdom of the Maharaja of Jashore as mine.
I will not sit on the throne of Jashore, nor will I touch the royal scepter of Jashore.
If I ever do, may all the sins of the murder of this granduncle be mine alone?"
Saying this, he shuddered.

When the queen heard that Udayaditya was leaving for Kashi, she came to Udayaditya and said, "Son Uday, take me with you."

Udayaditya said, "What are you saying, mother!
You have Samaraditya, your whole family is here, if you leave this place, then the goddess of wealth and prosperity will not remain in Jashore."

The queen cried and said, "My child, if you leave the family at this age, how will I be able to live with this family?
Leaving the kingdom and the family, you will become an ascetic—who will look after you there?
I cannot let you go, as your father is hard-hearted!"
The queen loved Udayaditya more than all her other children, and she started crying her heart out for Udayaditya.

Udayaditya held his mother's hand and said with tearful eyes, "Mother, you know that if I stay in the palace, there will be reasons to worry at every step - don't worry mother, I will go to the feet of Bisweshwar and be safe."

Udayaditya went to Bibha and said, "Bibha, my sister, before I leave for Kashi, I want to make you happy.
I want to take you to your in-laws' house myself, that is my only wish!"

Bibha asked Udayaditya, "Brother, how is granduncle?"

"Granduncle is well."
Saying this, Udayaditya quickly left from there.

## Chapter 35

Udayaditya and Bibha started preparing for their journey.
Bibha started crying, hugging her mother.
Everyone in the women's quarters, wherever they were, started giving Bibha various pieces of advice before she left for her in-laws' house.

The queen once called Udayaditya and said, "Son, they are taking Bibha away, what if they mistreat her!"

Udayaditya exclaimed in surprise, "Why, mother, why would they neglect her?"

The queen said, "Who knows if they are angry with Bibha!"

Udayaditya said - "No, mother, Bibha is a child, why would they ever get angry with Bibha?"

The queen said while crying, "My child, take her carefully, if they mistreat her, Bibha won't survive!"

A fear arose in Udayaditya's mind.
It had never occurred to him before that Bibha could be disrespected in her in-laws' house.
Udayaditya had thought that he had already suffered all the consequences of his actions, but he saw that it was not over yet.
He had given Bibha shelter, who knows what fate awaited Bibha as a result!

At the time of departure, Udayaditya and Bibha came to pay obeisance to their mother—lest the journey be disrupted, the queen did not cry at that moment, but as soon as they left, she fell to the ground and began to cry.
Udayaditya and Bibha paid obeisance to their father and other elders of the household.
Udayaditya took Samaraditya in his arms, kissed him and said to himself— "Son, may the curse of the throne you will ascend not touch you!"
The servants of the palace loved Udayaditya very much, they came one by one to pay obeisance to him, everyone started crying.
Finally, they both went to the temple, paid obeisance to the deity and started their journey.

The stage of sorrow, calamity and tyranny was left behind—the prison of life was left behind.
Udayaditya thought, I will never enter this house, this life again.
He looked back once.
He saw the bloodthirsty, hard-hearted palace standing with its head held high in the sky, like a demon.
Behind were left conspiracy, tyranny, bloodlust, oppression of the weak, tears of the helpless; in front was endless freedom, the unblemished beauty of nature, the natural affection and love of the heart stretched out two hands to embrace him.
It was just dawn then.
From the forest on the eastern bank of the river, the glow of the rays rose like a crest; the treetops were bathed in a golden hue—people were waking up, boatmen were happily singing songs, hoisting sails and opening boats.
Seeing this pure, serene, holy face of the morning, Udayaditya's soul sang the song of freedom with the birds.
He said to himself, "May I roam freely in this pure, verdant mood of nature for ages, and may I live together with the simple-hearted."

The boat set sail.
Both of them moved forward while listening to the boatmen's songs and the gurgling of water.
In Bibha's tranquil heart, the dawn of joy reigned, her face and eyes shone with the brilliance of the rising sun.
It was as if she had woken up from a nightmare after so many days and was relieved to see the world.
Bibha is going.
To whom is she going?
Who is calling her?
The eternal, unwavering love has called her—Bibha, like a little bird, will hide in the lap of that tender love, her wings folded, her heart filled with trust.
Today, she can see an ocean of affection all around her.
Udayaditya called Bibha near him and started narrating stories to her in a soft voice like the gurgling of water.
Whatever she heard—Bibha liked it.

Ramchandra Rai's boat entered the kingdom.
Looking around, Bibha felt an unprecedented joy in her heart.
What a beautiful sight!
Seeing the cottages and the people, Bibha felt that everyone was so happy!
Bibha felt like calling the subjects near her and asking them about their king.
Seeing the subjects, she felt a strange kind of affection for them in her heart.
She liked everyone she saw.
Occasionally, she saw one or two poor people, and Bibha thought to herself, "Alas, why is he in such a state?
I will go to the inner palace and send for him.
I will do whatever it takes to relieve his suffering."
She felt that everyone was her own.
She could not bear the poverty and suffering in this kingdom.
Bibha wished that the subjects would come to her and call her mother, tell her their sorrows, and she would remove those sorrows.

Udayaditya moored the boat in a village near the capital.
He decided that he would send a message to the palace to inform them of their arrival and they would come to receive them and take them there.
When he moored the boat, it was already evening.
Udayaditya thought that he would send someone tomorrow morning—Bibha wanted to send the message today itself.

## Chapter 36

Today, the servants are very busy.
Music is playing all around.
It is as if there is a festival in the village.
On the one hand, Bibha's heart is filled with uncontrollable joy, and on the other hand, hearing the sound of music all around, her heart feels like it is overflowing.
How hard she tries to suppress her laughter, lest Udayaditya notices her excessive joy!
Udayaditya went out to the village to see what was happening, seeing the festive atmosphere on the river bank.

Some time passed like this.
Someone from the bank asked, "Whose boat is that?"
The servants of the palace replied from the boat, "Who?
Rammohan?
Oh, come, come!"
Rammohan quickly got on the boat.
Bibha was sitting alone in the boat, and seeing Rammohan, she exclaimed with joy, "Mohan."

Rammohan - "Mother."

Rammohan was filled with that simple joy, looked at her smiling face for a long time and then said with a gloomy face - "Mother, did you come today?"

Bibha hurriedly said-
"Yes, Mohan.
Has the Maharaj received the news in the meantime?
Have you come to take me?"

Rammohan said, "No mother, don't be in such a hurry—leave it for today—I'll take it another day."

Seeing Rammohan's mood, Bibha became completely disheartened and said, "Why Mohan—why won't I go today!"

Rammohan said, "It's getting late in the evening today—stay today, mother."

Bibha, utterly frightened, said, "Tell me truly, Mohan, what has happened?"

Rammohan couldn't bear it.
Hiding was not his habit!
He sat down right there—and cried, saying—"Mother, today there is no place for you in your kingdom—no home for you in your palace.
Today the Maharaja is getting married."

Bibha's face turned completely pale.
Her hands and feet became ice-cold!
Rammohan started saying, "Mother, when your lowly son went to call you, why didn't you come, Mother?
Why did you turn me away like a cruel, heartless woman?
I have no face to show the Maharaj now!
My heart is breaking, yet I couldn't say a single word because of you!"

Bibha could not see anything anymore,—her head spun and she fell down right there.
Rammohan quickly brought water and sprinkled it on Bibha's face and eyes.
After a while, Bibha sat up.
Bibha's entire world had been shattered in one blow.
After coming to her husband's kingdom, reaching near the capital, and arriving at the palace gate, thirsty-hearted Bibha's hopes for happiness had vanished like a mirage.

Bibha said anxiously, "Mohan, he sent for me—was I very late in coming?"

Mohan said, "It's getting late, isn't it?"

Bibha said impatiently - "Will you not forgive me anymore?"

Mohan said - "Why didn't you forgive him?"

Bibha said, "Mohan, I will just go and see him once."
Saying this, she burst into tears.

Rammohan wiped his eyes and said, "Not today, mother."

Bibha said, "No Mohan, I will go and see him once today."

Rammohan said, "Let the Crown Prince return from the village first."

Bibha said, "No Mohan, I'll go once more."

Bibha thought that Udayaditya might not let her go out of fear of being humiliated if he heard this news.

Rammohan said - "Then bring a palanquin."

Bibha said, "Why a palanquin?
Am I a queen to need a palanquin?
I will go like an ordinary subject, like a beggar woman—what use do I have for a palanquin?"

Rammohan said, "As long as I am alive, I will not allow that to happen."

Bibha said in a pleading voice, "Mohan, I beg you, don't stop me anymore—I'm getting late!"

Rammohan said with a pained heart, "Alright mother, so be it."

Bibha got out of the boat disguised as a young woman.
The boat's servants came and said, "What is this, mother?
Why are you going somewhere dressed like this?"

Rammohan said - "This is mother's kingdom, she can go wherever she wants!"

The servants started to object, Rammohan pushed them aside.

## Chapter 37

There were people and crowd all around.
Earlier, Bibha would have died of embarrassment, but today nothing seemed to catch her eye.
Whatever she saw, it all seemed like a lie to Bibha.
All around her, there was a cacophony of a dream—nothing seemed to be anything.
All she could see was a crowd, all she could hear was a commotion, but it all seemed meaningless to her.

As she was coming near the entrance of the palace through the crowd, a gatekeeper suddenly caught hold of Bibha's hand and stopped her—at that moment Bibha suddenly came back to reality—she looked around and felt ashamed.
Her veil had come off, she quickly pulled her veil over her head.
Rammohan was walking ahead, he turned back and glared at the gatekeeper—Fernandez was nearby, he came and scolded the gatekeeper.
Bibha entered the palace.
Bibha entered the palace like any other maidservant—no one paid any attention to her!

Only the king and the jester, Ramai Bhaand, were sitting in the room.
Bibha entered the room, looked at the king's face, and fell to the ground at the king's feet.
The king stood up in surprise and asked, "Who are you?
A beggar—have you come to beg?"

Bibha raised her tearful face and looked at the king and said, "No, Your Majesty, I have come to give you everything I have.
I have come to bid you farewell by surrendering you into someone else's hands."

Rammohan could not stay away, he came near and said - "Maharaj, your queen - the princess of Jashore."

Suddenly Ramchandra Roy's soul seemed to be startled—but immediately the jester Ramai laughed and glancing at the king said in a harsh voice, "Why, don't you like your elder brother any more?"

Ramchandra Ray's heart was filled with compassion, yet he laughed cruelly at Ramai's words—he thought—if he showed affection to Bibha now, he might become an object of ridicule.

Bibha felt as if a thousand thunderbolts had struck her head at once—she was utterly mortified—she closed her eyes and said in her mind—Oh Mother Earth, please open up and swallow me!
She looked around in panic—she looked at Rammohan's face with helpless eyes!

Rammohan came running and forcefully grabbed hold of Romai the buffoon's neck and threw him out of the house.

The king became angry and said, "Rammohan, you are being impertinent in front of me!"

Rammohan said with a trembling voice, "Your Majesty, I have committed a grave offense!
Your queen insulted my mother, I will shave her head, pour ashes on it, and banish her from the city, only then my name will be Rammohan!"

He threatened Raja Rammohan and said, "Who is my queen?
I don't know her!"

Bibha's face turned pale, she covered her face with her veil, her whole body started trembling, and finally, trembling and trembling, Bibha fainted and fell to the ground.
Then Rammohan folded his hands and said to the king, "Your Majesty, for four generations, we have been serving your dynasty.
We have been taking care of you since your childhood.
Today, you have insulted my mistress, you have driven away the goddess of fortune of your kingdom - today I also quit your service and leave - I will serve my mistress and spend my life.
I will beg and eat, but I will not cross the shadow of this palace."
Saying this, Rammohan bowed to the king and said to Bibha, "Come on mother, come on!
Leave this place quickly!
Don't stay here for a moment longer."
Saying this, he picked up Bibha and brought her.
There were many palanquins near the door, he lifted the unconscious and exhausted Bibha into one of them and returned to the boat.

Bibha went to Kashi with Udayaditya.
There she spent her life in charity, meditation, worshiping deities, and serving her brother.
Rammohan was with them as long as he lived.
Sitaram also came to Kashi with his family and took shelter with Udayaditya.

The market in Chandradwip in front of which Bibha's boat had anchored, is still known as "Bou-Thakurani'r Haat" (Bou-Thakurani's Market).
