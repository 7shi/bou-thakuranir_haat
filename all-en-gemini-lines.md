# Bou-Thakurani's Market

## Chapter 1

It was late at night.
It was summertime.
The wind had stopped blowing.
Not even a leaf on the trees was stirring.
The crown prince of Jessore, Pratapaditya's eldest son, Udayaditya, was sitting at the window of his bedchamber.
Beside him was his wife, Surma.

Surma said, “Dearest, bear with it, be patient.
A day of happiness will come.”

Udayaditya said, “I desire no other happiness.
I wish I had not been born in a royal palace, had not been the crown prince, had been a subject of the lowliest, most insignificant subject of the ruler of Jessore—not his eldest son, not the sole heir to his throne, to all his wealth, honor, fame, influence, and glory!
What penance could I perform to reverse this past?”

Surma, becoming very distressed, took the prince's right hand in both of her hands and held it tightly, and looking at his face, she let out a long, slow sigh.
She could give her life to fulfill the prince's wish, but her sorrow was that even giving her life could not fulfill this wish.

The prince said, “Surma, it is because I was born into a king's family that I could not be happy.
It seems that in a king's family, everyone is born only as an heir, not as a son.
From my childhood, Father has been testing me at every moment, to see whether I can maintain the honor and fame he has earned, whether I can bring glory to the lineage, whether I can bear the heavy burden of the kingdom.
He has been observing my every action, every gesture, with the eyes of an examiner, not with the eyes of affection.
Relatives, ministers, courtiers, and subjects have all been scrutinizing my every word and deed to foretell my future.
Everyone shook their heads and said—no, this perilous kingdom cannot be protected by me.
I am a fool, I understand nothing.
Everyone began to neglect me, Father began to despise me.
He gave up on me completely.
He wouldn't even check on me once!”

Tears came to Surma's eyes.
She said, “Ah!
How could he!”
She felt sad, she felt angry, she said, “Those who thought you a fool are the fools themselves!”

Udayaditya smiled slightly, held Surma's chin, and gently shook her face, which was flushed with anger.
In a moment, he became serious and said—

“No, Surma, truly I do not have the intellect for ruling a kingdom.
That has been tested enough.
When I was sixteen, the Maharaj, to teach me the work, entrusted the responsibility of the Hosenkhali pargana to my hands.
Within six months, terrible disorder began to arise.
The revenue collection decreased, the subjects began to bless me; the officials began to complain against me to the king.
The consensus in the royal court was that since the crown prince has become so beloved by the subjects, it is clear that he will never be capable of ruling the kingdom.
From then on, the Maharaj hardly ever looked at me.
He would say—That disgrace to the family will be just like his uncle Basanta Ray of Raigarh; he will play the sitar and dance around and drive the kingdom to ruin.”

Surma said again, “Dearest, bear with it, be patient.
After all, he is your father.
Nowadays, his entire heart is filled with the sole, desperate hope of acquiring and expanding the kingdom; there is no room for affection there.
As his ambitions are fulfilled, the realm of his affection will grow.”

The prince said, “Surma, your intellect is sharp and far-sighted, but this time you have misunderstood.
Firstly, there is no end to ambition; secondly, the more my father's kingdom expands, the more territory he acquires, the more the fear of losing it will grow in his mind; the more serious the affairs of the state become, the more unfit he will consider me for them.”

Surma had not misunderstood, she had merely believed wrongly; faith can transcend intellect.
She single-mindedly hoped that it would be so.

“Unable to bear the pitying glances from some and the neglect from others, I would occasionally run away to my grand-uncle’s place in Raigarh!
Father rarely bothered to look for me.
Ah, what a change that was.
There, I could see trees and plants, I could visit the villagers’ cottages, and I didn’t have to wear royal attire day and night.
Besides, you know that wherever Grand-uncle is, no trace of sorrow, anxiety, or stern gravity can remain.
He fills the surroundings with singing, playing, and merriment.
There was cheerfulness and goodwill all around; whenever I went there, I would forget that I was the Yubaraj of Jessore.
What a welcome oblivion!
Finally, when I was eighteen, a spring breeze was blowing in Raigarh; there were green groves all around, and in that spring, I saw Rukmini.”

Surma exclaimed, “I have heard that story many times!”

Udayaditya said, “Hear it once more.
At times, a certain story keeps stinging my heart, and if I don’t let these words out, how will I live?
I am still ashamed to tell you that story, it still pains me, so I tell it again and again.
The day I feel no shame, no pain, that day I will know my penance is over, and I will not say it again.”

Surma said, “Penance for what, my dearest?
If you have sinned, it is the sin's fault, not yours.
Don't I know you?
Does the one who sees into your heart not see your mind?”

Udayaditya continued, “Rukmini was three years older than me.
She was a lone widow.
By Grand-uncle’s grace, she was allowed to live in Raigarh.
I don't remember by what trick she first drew me to her.
At that time, the midday sun was blazing in my mind.
The light was so harsh that I couldn't see anything clearly; the world around me was shrouded in a luminous vapor.
All the blood seemed to rush to my head; nothing felt surprising, nothing impossible; path, wrong path, direction, and misdirection all merged into one.
Nothing like this had ever happened to me before, and nothing like it ever happened again.
Jagadishwar knows what purpose of His He was fulfilling by inciting the entire universe against this small, weak, foolish heart for a single day.
The whole of creation, as if in unison, led my tiny heart astray in a moment.
Just a moment—no more.
A momentary, cruel blow from the entire outer world, and in an instant, the very root of a fragile heart was torn apart; with the speed of lightning, it fell and embraced the dust.
When it rose again, it was dust-covered, tarnished.
That dust was never wiped away; the stain of that tarnish never lifted.
What had I done, O Vidhat, that for my sin you blackened all the whiteness of my life in a single moment?
Turned day into night?
In my heart’s flower garden, even the faces of the jasmine flowers seemed to turn black with shame!”

As he spoke, Udayaditya’s fair face turned crimson, his large eyes widened further, and a tremor like a bolt of lightning ran from his head to his feet.
Surma, with a mix of joy, pride, and pain, said, “Swear on my head, let that be.”

Udayaditya said, “Slowly, when my blood cooled, when I could see everything in its proper measure; when the world no longer seemed like the misty, spinning dreamscape of a hot-headed, bloodshot-eyed drunkard, but a real field of action, what a state my mind was in!
What a fall from such a height!
In the blink of an eye, I fell hundreds of thousands of millions of leagues into the abyss of the netherworld, into a dark, darker, darkest night.
Grand-uncle affectionately called me to him; how could I show my face to him?
But from then on, I had to leave Raigarh.
Grand-uncle couldn't bear not seeing me.
He would send for me.
I was so afraid that I could not bring myself to go.
He himself would come to see me and my sister Vibha.
No pride, nothing.
He wouldn't even ask why I hadn't come.
He would see us, make merry, and leave.”

Udayaditya smiled slightly, his large eyes flooding with a very gentle, tender love as he looked at Surma’s face.
Surma understood what words were coming now.
Her face lowered; she grew slightly restless.
The Yubaraj took her cheeks in both his hands and lifted her bowed face; he moved closer to her; he gently laid her head on his shoulder.
He wrapped his left arm around her waist and, with deep, tranquil love, kissed her cheek and said—

“Then what happened, Surma, tell me?
From where did this face, radiant with intelligence, soft with affection and love, bright with smiles, and pure with tranquil grace, arise?
Did I have any hope that my deep darkness would break?
You are my Usha, my light, my hope.
With what magic spell did you banish that darkness?”
The Yubaraj kissed Surma’s face again and again.
Surma said nothing; her eyes filled with tears of joy.
The Yubaraj said,—

“After all this time, I have found my true refuge.
From you, I first heard that I am not a fool, and I believed it, I understood it.
It was from you I learned that intelligence is not a dark, small alley, crooked and uneven, but straight, level, and wide like a royal road.
Before, I used to hate myself, neglect myself.
I didn't dare to do anything.
If my mind said, ‘This is right,’ my self-doubting nature would say, ‘It might not be right.’
I would endure whatever treatment I received, not trying to think for myself.
After all this time, I feel that I am something, I am someone.
I was hidden for so long; you have brought me out, Surma, you have discovered me.
Now, whatever my mind says is good, I want to accomplish it at once.
I have such faith in you that when you believe in me, I too can fearlessly believe in myself.
Where was there so much strength in that delicate body that you have made me strong as well?”

But with a feeling of immense reliance, Surma wrapped her arms around her husband’s chest.
With what a look of complete self-surrender she gazed at his face!
Her eyes said, “I have nothing else, only you, and so I have everything!”

From childhood, Udayaditya had been enduring the neglect of his relatives, and sometimes, late on a quiet, deep night, he loved to discuss his old life story, told a hundred times, with Surma, part by part, step by step.

Udayaditya said, “How much longer can it go on like this, Surma?
In the royal court, the courtiers look at me with a kind of pity, and in the inner quarters, Mother torments you; even the servants don't respect you much.
I can't say anything properly to anyone; I remain quiet, I endure.
You have a spirited nature, yet you too endure in silence.
Since I couldn't make you happy, since you've only had to endure insult and pain from me, it would have been better if we had not married.”

Surma replied, “What are you saying, my lord?
This is exactly the time when Surma is needed.
What could I have done for you in times of happiness?
In happy times, Surma is an object of luxury, a plaything.
Overcoming all sorrow, this happiness awakens in my heart that I am of use to you, that I am enjoying the immeasurable joy that comes from suffering for your sake.
My only sorrow is, why couldn't I bear all your troubles?”

The Yubaraj remained silent for a while and then said, “I don't worry so much for myself.
I've gotten used to everything.
But why should you endure insults for my sake?
You have comforted me in my sorrow like a true wife, given me rest when I was weary, but I, like a husband, could not protect you from insult and shame.
Because your father, the king of Shripur, does not acknowledge my father as his superior, does not accept his place under the dominion of Jessore, Father wants to maintain his own supremacy by showing you neglect.
If someone insults you, he doesn't even listen.
He thinks that making you his daughter-in-law is enough of an honor for you.
Sometimes I think I can't take it anymore, that I'll leave everything and go away with you.
I might have gone by now; only you have kept me here.”

The night grew deep.
Many evening stars had set, and many late-night stars had risen.
The footsteps of the guards at the fortress gate could be heard from a distance.
The entire world was fast asleep.
All the lamps in the city had been extinguished; the doors of the houses were shut; save for a chance jackal or two, there was not a soul to be seen.
The door to Udayaditya's bedchamber was shut.
Suddenly, someone began to knock on the door from outside.
The flustered prince opened the door.
"Why?
Vibha?
What has happened?
Why have you come here so late at night?"

Readers are already aware that Vibha is Udayaditya's sister.
Vibha said, “By now, I fear, all is lost!”
Surma and Udayaditya asked in unison, “Why, what has happened?”
In a voice trembling with fear, Vibha whispered something.
As she spoke, she could no longer hold back and burst into tears, saying, “Dada, what will happen?”

Udayaditya said, “Then I must go!”
Vibha cried out, “No, no, don't you go.”

Udayaditya: “Why, Vibha?”

Vibha: “What if Father finds out?
What if he gets angry with you?”

Surma said, “Fie, Vibha!
Is this the time to think of that?”

Udayaditya, having dressed and fastened a sword to his waistband, prepared to depart.
Vibha, grabbing his hand, said, “Dada, don't you go.
Send someone else.
I am so scared.”

Udayaditya said, “Vibha, do not stop me now; there is no more time.”
Saying this, he went out immediately.

Vibha, holding Surma's hand, said, “What will happen, sister?
What if Father finds out?”

Surma replied, “What more can happen?
I believe there is no affection left.
It will not be a great loss if what little remains is also gone.”

Vibha said, “No, sister, I am terrified.
What if Father causes some kind of harm?
What if he punishes him?”

Surma, sighing deeply, said, “I believe that he who has no helper in this world has the greater help of Narayan.
O Lord, let there be no stain upon Your name!
Do not shatter this faith of mine!”

## Chapter 2

The minister said, “Maharaj, will this be a good course of action?”

Pratapaditya asked, “Which action?”

The minister said, “The one you ordered yesterday.”

Pratapaditya, annoyed, said, “What did I order yesterday?”

The minister said, “Regarding your paternal uncle.”

Pratapaditya, even more annoyed, said, “What about my paternal uncle?”

The minister said, “Maharaj had ordered that when Basanta Ray takes shelter at the inn in Simultali on his way to Jessore, then—”

Pratapaditya, frowning, said, “Then what?
Just finish the sentence!”

The minister—“Then two Pathan men will go and—”

Pratap—“Yes.”

The minister—“And kill him.”

Pratapaditya said angrily, “Minister, have you suddenly become a child?
Why must I ask ten questions to hear one thing?
Are you hesitant to even speak the words!
I suppose your age for attending to state affairs has passed; the time has now come to think of the afterlife.
Why have you not requested leave before this?”

The minister—“Maharaj has not quite understood my sentiment.”

Pratap—“I have understood it perfectly.
But let me ask you one thing: a deed that I can do, you cannot even bring yourself to speak of?
You should have considered that when I am about to do such a thing, there must be a grave reason for it; I must have considered all aspects of dharma and adharma.”

The minister—“Your Majesty, I—”

Pratap—“Be quiet, listen to all I have to say first.
When I am doing this—when I am preparing to kill my own paternal uncle, I have of course thought about it far more than you have.
There is no adharma in this act.
This is my vow—that these Mlechchhas who have come to our country and begun their misdeeds, by whose oppression the eternal Arya Dharma is on the verge of being erased from our land, Kshatriyas are giving their daughters to the Mughal, Hindus are deviating from their customs—I will drive these Mlechchhas out, I will free our Arya Dharma from the grasp of Rahu.
To fulfill this vow, much strength is needed.
I want all the kings of Bengal to be united under me.
This will not be accomplished without destroying those who are friends of the Yavana.
My paternal uncle Basanta Ray is venerable, but there is no sin in speaking the truth—he is a stain on our lineage.
He has acknowledged himself as a slave to the Mlechchha; Pratapaditya Ray has no relation to such a man.
If a wound develops, one can cut off one's own arm.
It is my wish to cut off that wound of our lineage, that wound of Bengal, that Basanta Ray, and save the Ray Bamsa, save Bengal.”

The minister said, “On this matter, I did not have a different opinion from Maharaj.”

Pratapaditya said—“Yes, you did.
Speak the truth.
You still do.
Look, Minister, as long as your opinion does not align with mine, you must express it.
If you do not have that courage, then this post is not for you.
If you have doubts, speak them.
Give me the opportunity to explain.
You are thinking that to kill one's own paternal uncle is always a sin.
Don't say 'no', that is precisely the thought that is rising in your mind.
There is an answer to this.
At his father's request, Bhrigu killed his own mother.
For the sake of dharma, can I not kill my paternal uncle?”

On this matter—that is, on the matter of dharma and adharma—the minister truly had no opinion.
The minister had plumbed depths the king had not.
The minister knew very well that if he showed hesitation in the present matter, the king would be somewhat angered for the moment, but in the end, he would be inwardly pleased by it.
Without acting this way, at some point or another, the king's suspicion and fear might have been aroused against the minister.

The minister said, “I was saying that the Emperor of Delhi will surely be displeased upon hearing this news.”

Pratapaditya flared up, “Yes, yes, he will be displeased!
Everyone has the right to be displeased.
The Emperor of Delhi is not my God.
There are plenty of creatures who will tremble and shake if he gets angry—there's Mansingh, there's Birbal, there's our Basanta Ray, and recently I see you are one too; but do not think everyone is like yourself.”

The minister said with a smile, “Indeed, Maharaj, I am not much afraid of empty anger either, but if it comes with shields and swords, then one must certainly think twice!
The Emperor of Delhi's anger means fifty thousand soldiers.”

Unable to give a proper reply to this, Pratapaditya said, “Look, minister, do not try to dissuade me from any task by showing me the fear of the Emperor of Delhi.
I find it deeply insulting.”

The minister said, “What will the subjects say if they find out?”

Pratap—“If they find out, that is.”

Minister—“This deed will not remain hidden for long.”

“When this news spreads, all of Bengal will oppose you.
The very purpose for which you want to do this deed will be destroyed at its root.
They will excommunicate you, and you will have to endure various afflictions.”

Pratap—“Look, minister, I am telling you again, whatever I do, I do after much consideration.
Therefore, once I have begun a task, do not try to dissuade me by showing me a bunch of empty fears.
I am not a child.
I have not kept you as my personal chain to obstruct me at every step.”

The minister fell silent.
The king had two orders for him.
One, he was to express his disagreement as long as it existed; two, he was not to try to dissuade the king from any action by expressing his opposing view.
To this day, the minister had not been able to properly reconcile these two orders.

After a short while, the minister spoke again, “Maharaj, the Emperor of Delhi—!”

Pratapaditya flared up and said, “The Emperor of Delhi again?
Minister, if you took the name of Jagadishwar as many times a day as you take the name of the Emperor of Delhi, you could have sorted out your afterlife.
Until this task of mine is finished, do not bring the name of the Emperor of Delhi to your lips.
When I receive the news of this task's completion this afternoon, then you may come and chant the Emperor's name in my ear to your heart's content!
Until then, practice a little self-restraint!”

The minister fell silent again.
Changing the subject from the Emperor of Delhi, he said, “Maharaj, Prince Udayaditya—”

The king said, “First the Emperor of Delhi, then the subjects; now will you finally try to frighten me by mentioning that effeminate boy?”

The minister said, “Maharaj, you are gravely mistaken.
I have no intention whatsoever of obstructing your work.”

Pratapaditya, calming down, said, “Then tell me what you were about to say!”

The minister said, “Last night, the Prince suddenly mounted his horse and left alone.
He has not yet returned.”

Pratapaditya asked irritably, “Which way did he go?”

The minister replied, “Eastward.”

Pratapaditya, grinding his teeth, said, “When did he leave?”

The minister: “Last night, around midnight.”

Pratapaditya said, “Is the daughter of the zamindar of Shripur still here?”

The minister: “Yes, Your Majesty!”

Pratapaditya: “It would be better if she stayed at her father’s house.”

The minister gave no reply.

Pratapaditya said, “Udayaditya was never king-like.
Who knew that my own son would turn out like this?
Does a lion cub have to be taught how to become a lion?
But then, ‘narāṇāṃ mātulakramaḥ’—men take after their maternal uncles.
I suppose he has inherited the nature of his mother's family.
On top of that, I recently married him into the house of Shripur; ever since then, the boy has gone completely to ruin.
May God grant that my younger son proves worthy, so that if I cannot finish what I have started, I will not be left with worries at the time of my death!
So, has he still not returned?”

The minister: “No, Maharaj!”

Stamping his foot on the ground, Pratapaditya said, “Why did a guard not go with him?”

The minister: “One was prepared to go, but he forbade it.”

Pratapaditya: “Why didn't one follow him unseen, from a distance?”

The minister: “They did not suspect any wrongdoing.”

Pratapaditya: “Did not suspect!
Minister, are you trying to convince me that they did a fine job?
Minister, do not try to make me understand some pointless justification.
The guards have been grossly negligent in their duty.
Summon whoever was at the gate at that time.
If any one of my wishes is thwarted because of this incident, I will bring utter ruin.
Minister, then you too will have cause to be afraid.
You have come to prove to me that no one is responsible for this!
In that case, the responsibility is yours!”

Pratapaditya sent for the guards.
After a moment of grim silence, he asked, “Yes.
What were you saying about the Emperor of Delhi?”

The minister: “I have heard that a complaint has been lodged against you with the Emperor of Delhi.”

Pratapaditya: “Who?
Your Prince Udayaditya, is it?”

The minister: “Your Majesty, please do not say such things.
I have not discovered who did it.”

Pratapaditya: “Whoever it may be, do not worry much about it.
I am the judge of the Emperor of Delhi; I myself am arranging his punishment.
Have those Pathans not returned yet?
Has Udayaditya still not come?
Summon the guards quickly.”

## Chapter 3

The Yubaraj galloped his horse at lightning speed down the desolate path.
It was a dark night, but as the path was long, straight, and wide, there was no fear of danger.
In the still night, the sound of the horse's hooves echoed all around; a dog or two barked 'ghue-ghue', and a couple of jackals, startled, left the path to hide in the bamboo groves.
For light, there were stars in the sky and fireflies in the trees by the roadside; for sound, there was the incessant chirping of crickets; for humanity, there was a single skeletal old beggar woman sleeping under a tree!
After covering a distance of five kroshas, the Yubaraj left the path and descended into a field.
He had to rein in the horse's speed.
It had rained during the day, the ground was wet, and the horse's hooves sank at every step.
As it went, the horse fell three times, putting its weight on its front legs.
The exhausted horse's nostrils were flared, its mouth was foaming, foam had formed from the chafing of its hind legs, a sound was emerging from within its ribs, and its entire body was drenched in sweat.
Meanwhile, the heat was oppressive, there was not a trace of wind, and there was still a long way to go.
After crossing numerous marshes and ploughed fields, the Yubaraj finally reached an unpaved road.
He urged the horse to gallop again.
He patted its neck once encouragingly and called, 'Sugriva!'
Startled, the horse pricked up its ears for a moment and looked at its master with large, slanted eyes, then arched its neck and neighed, forcefully lowered its head to slacken the reins, and, with neck bent, began to run breathlessly.
The trees on either side were barely visible; looking at the sky, it seemed as if groups of stars were flying by furiously like sparks of fire, and the still air, rippling, began to whoosh past his ears.
When it was the third watch of the night, as the jackals began to howl near the human settlements, the Yubaraj stopped at the door of the inn at Simultali; his horse, instantly lifeless, fell to the ground.
He dismounted, patted its back, lifted its head, and called 'Sugriva' many times, but it did not move again.
With a deep sigh, the Yubaraj went to the door and knocked.
After repeated knocks, the innkeeper, without opening the door, spoke through a window—'Who are you at this late hour?'
He saw an armed young man standing at the door.

The Yubaraj said, 'Open the door, I have a question to ask.'

He replied, 'What need is there to open the door?
Just ask what you have to ask!'

The Yubaraj asked—'Is King Basanta Ray of Raigarh here?'

He replied—'Sir, he was supposed to arrive after evening, but he has not come yet.
I suppose he will not be coming today.'

The Yubaraj took out two coins, and making them jingle, said—'Take these.'

He hurried over, opened the door, and took the two coins.
Then the Yubaraj said to him—'My good man, I would like to search your inn to see who is here.'

The innkeeper said suspiciously—'No, sir, that cannot be done.'

Udayaditya said—'Do not stop me.
I am an official from the royal palace.
I have come in search of two criminals.'

Saying this, he entered.
The innkeeper did not stop him any longer.
He searched the entire place.
He found neither Basanta Ray, nor his attendants, nor any Pathan.
Only two middle-aged women, woken from their sleep, shrieked, 'Death to you, you wretch!
Why are you staring like that?'

Emerging from the inn, the Yubaraj stood on the path and began to think.
For a moment, he thought that it was for the best; perhaps by a stroke of fate, his uncle had been unable to come today.
Then again, he thought, what if he is at a previous inn and the Pathans have gone there in search of him?
Lost in such thoughts, he started walking down that path.
After going a short distance, he saw a horseman approaching from the opposite direction.
When he came closer, he called out, 'Who is it?
Ratan?'

The man immediately dismounted from his horse, bowed to him, and said, 'Indeed, sire.
Yubaraj, what brings you here at this hour?'

The Yubaraj said, 'I will tell you the reason later.
For now, tell me, where is my grand-uncle?'

'Sire, he was supposed to be at the inn.'

'What?
But I did not see him there.'

The man, astonished, said, 'The Maharaj set out for Jessore with thirty attendants.
I was delayed on an errand.
I was supposed to meet him at this inn this evening.'

'With this much mud on the road, there ought to be footprints.
I will follow them to find him.
I am taking your horse.
You follow on foot!'

## Chapter 4

By a deserted road, under an Ashvattha tree, the old Basanta Ray sat inside a palanquin that rested on the ground, its bearers gone.
No one else was near, only a Pathan outside the palanquin.
The clamor of a crowd faded into the distance.
The night grew still.
Basanta Ray asked—

“Khan Saheb, why didn't you leave?”

The Pathan replied, “Huzur, how could I leave?
You sent all your own retainers away to protect our lives and property.
Do not consider me so ungrateful as to abandon you here, unprotected on the road at night.
Our poet says, 'He who harms me is in my debt, and he must repay it in the afterlife; but he who does me good, I am indebted to him, and I can never repay that debt.'”

Basanta Ray thought to himself, “Bravo, this man is truly good.”
After a moment's reflection, he stuck his bald head out of the palanquin and said, “Khan Saheb, you are a very good man.”

Khan Saheb immediately made a salaam.
On this matter, he had no disagreement whatsoever with Basanta Ray.
Basanta Ray, observing his face in the torchlight, said, “You seem to be a man from a noble family.”

The Pathan salaamed again and said, “How astonishing, Maharaj, you have perceived it exactly.”

Basanta Ray said, “What do you do now?”

The Pathan sighed and said, “Huzur, I have fallen on hard times.
I now get by with farming.
The poet says—‘Oh, Fate, there is no cruelty in your making grass as grass, but when you make a great Ashvattha tree, only to lay it level with the grass in the hands of a storm, I surmise that your heart is made of stone!’”

Utterly delighted, Basanta Ray exclaimed, “Bravo, bravo, what words the poet has spoken!
Saheb, the two couplets you've recited today, you must write them down for me.”

The Pathan thought that his fortune was smiling on him.
The old man was excellent; he could be of great use to a poor man.
Basanta Ray thought, “Alas, a man who was once of high standing is now in such a sorry state!
What tyranny from the fickle Lakshmi!”
Feeling somewhat distressed in his heart, he said to the Pathan—

“With a fine physique like yours, you could easily be employed in the army.”

The Pathan immediately exclaimed, “Of course I can, Huzur!
That is our profession.
My father and grandfathers all died with a sword in hand, and that is my only wish as well.
The poet says—”

Basanta Ray said with a laugh, “Whatever the poet may say, my dear man, if you accept my employment, your wish to die with a sword in hand may yet be fulfilled, but it will not be your fate to draw that sword from its sheath.
I have grown old; my subjects are happy and at peace.
May Bhagavan grant that there be no more need for war.
My fighting days are past; I have given up the sword.
Now, in place of the sword, another has taken my hand.”
Saying this, he gave a strum or two to awaken his companion, the sitar, lying beside him.

The Pathan, nodding and closing his eyes, said, “Ah, what you say is true.
There is a couplet: ‘The sword can conquer an enemy, but music can turn an enemy into a friend.’”

Basanta Ray exclaimed, “What did you say, Khan Saheb?
Music can turn an enemy into a friend, how wonderful!”
He fell silent, thinking for a moment, and the more he thought, the more amazed he seemed to become.
After a while, he began to explain the couplet, “That a thing as terrible as the sword cannot destroy enmity itself—how can one say it destroys it?
Curing a disease by killing the patient, what kind of cure is that?
But music, such a sweet thing, can destroy enmity without destroying the enemy.
Is this the stuff of ordinary poetry?
Bravo, what praise!”
The old man became so agitated that he put his feet outside the palanquin and sat up, beckoning the Pathan closer and saying, “The sword can conquer an enemy, but music can turn even an enemy into a friend, isn't that so, Khan Saheb?”

The Pathan replied, “Yes, Huzur.”

Basanta Ray said, “You must visit me in Raigarh.
When I return from Jessore, I will help you as best I can!”

Overjoyed, the Pathan said, “Is there anything you cannot do if you wish it!”
The Pathan thought, “I've arranged things quite nicely.”
He asked, “Do you know how to play the sitar?”

Basanta Ray said, “Yes,” and immediately picked up the sitar.
Fastening the plectrum to his finger, he began to play an alap in the raga Vehag.
From time to time, the Pathan would nod his head and exclaim, “Bravo!
Exquisite!”
Gradually, under the influence of his excitement, it became impossible for Basanta Ray to remain seated in the palanquin.
He stood up and continued to play.
He forgot all about dignity, solemnity, and his own self, and while playing, he finally began to sing—“Keyse katongi rayan, so piya bina.”
(How will I pass the night, without my beloved.)

When the song ended, the Pathan said, “Wah!
What a wonderful voice.”

Basanta Ray replied, “Perhaps, then, in the still of the night, in an open field, everyone's voice sounds sweet.
Because, though I have practiced my voice a great deal, people do not often praise its quality.
But then again, for every ailment Vidhata has given, he has also given a cure; similarly, for every voice He has created, there is at least one listener.
I, too, have a couple of foolish youngsters to whom my voice sounds good.
If not for them, Saheb, I would have closed down this singing shop long ago.
I have those two amateur customers who don't know the quality of the goods, and it is from them I receive praise.
I haven't seen the two of them for a long time, and so my music and singing have also stopped.
That is why I am rushing to them now; I shall sing to them to my heart's content, unburden my soul, and then return home.”
The old man's dimly lit eyes shone with affection and joy.

The Pathan thought to himself, “One of your wishes has been fulfilled—you've had your song.
Now, shall I be the one to unburden your soul?
Toba, toba, to think of doing such a thing!
There is merit, it's true, in killing a kafir, but I have earned so much of that merit that I have little worry for the afterlife.
But seeing how disorganized my worldly affairs are, I see no objection to making some arrangement with this kafir instead of killing him.”

Basanta Ray could not remain silent for long; his imagination stirred.
Drawing close to the Pathan, he whispered, “Do you know who I was speaking of, Saheb?
They are my grandson and granddaughter.”
As he spoke, he grew impatient, thinking, “When will my retainers return?”
He took up the sitar again and began to sing.

A horseman approached and said, “Ah, what a relief.
Grand-uncle, who are you playing music for on the roadside at this late hour?”

Overcome with joy and surprise, Basanta Ray immediately set his sitar down inside the palanquin, took Udayaditya’s hand to help him down, and embraced him tightly.
He asked, “What is the news, my boy?
Is your sister well?”

Udayaditya replied, “All is well.”

The old man then laughed, picked up his sitar, and tapping his foot to the rhythm and shaking his head, began to sing.

“My love, why appear at such an odd hour?

I believe this must all be a dream.

You were in Chandrabali’s grove, where you found much adoration, no?

Did your heart’s desire for love end so soon?

The night is still here, the dawn has not yet broken,

And this Radhika’s tears have not yet ceased to fall.

Has Chandrabali’s floral garland already withered today?

O Chakor bird, has the sweet smile of that moon-like face faded away?”

Looking towards the Pathan, Udayaditya whispered in Basanta Ray’s ear, “Grand-uncle, where did this Kabuli turn up from?”

Basanta Ray hastily replied, “Khan Saheb is a very good man.
A discerning person.
This night has been spent in great delight.”

Seeing Udayaditya, Khan Saheb had become very agitated in his mind, unable to decide what to do.

Udayaditya asked his grand-uncle, “Why are you here, instead of at the inn?”

The Pathan suddenly spoke up.
“Your Highness, if I have your assurance, I have something to say.
We are subjects of King Pratapaditya.
The Maharaj ordered me and my brother to kill you on the road as you were heading towards Jessore!”

Startled, Basanta Ray cried out, “Ram, Ram, Ram!”

Udayaditya said, “Continue!”

The Pathan— “We have never done such a thing, and when we objected, he threatened us in various ways.
So we were forced to set out on this task.
We met you on the road.
My brother took your followers away, wailing that dacoits had attacked the village.
The burden of this task fell upon me.
But, Maharaj, although it is the king’s order, I could not bring myself to do such a deed.
Because, our poet says, ‘By the king’s command, by the master’s command, you may destroy the whole earth, but beware, do not destroy even a corner of heaven.’
Now this poor man seeks the Maharaja’s refuge.
If I return to my country, I will be ruined.
I have no other hope if you do not protect me!”
Saying this, he stood with folded hands.

Basanta Ray stood there, stunned.
After a while, he said to the Pathan— “I will give you a letter.
You go to Raigarh.
When I return there, I will arrange something for you.”

Udayaditya said, “Grand-uncle, are you still going to Jessore?”

Basanta Ray said, “Yes, my boy!”

Udayaditya asked, stunned, “What are you saying!”

Basanta Ray— “Pratap is not a stranger to me.
Even if he commits a thousand offenses, he is still very dear to me!
I do not fear any harm to myself.
My boy, I am standing on the shore of the ocean of existence; a single wave is enough to end it all for me.
But can I rest easy thinking of the harm this sinful act would bring to Pratap in this life and the next?
I will embrace him and explain everything to him once.”

As he spoke, tears welled up in Basanta Ray’s eyes.
Udayaditya covered his eyes with both his hands.

At that moment, Basanta Ray’s retainers returned, making a commotion.

“Where is the Maharaj?
Where is the Maharaj?”

“I'm right here, my boy, where else would I go?”

Everyone said in unison, “Where is that Nere scoundrel?”

A flustered Basanta Ray intervened, saying, “Yes, yes, my boy, don't you say anything to your Khan Saheb.”

First: “Today, Maharaj, we have suffered greatly.
Today he—”

Second: “You be quiet!
I'll explain it all properly.
That Pathan scoundrel led us straight on and finally into a mango grove on the left—”

Third: “No, it was an acacia wood.”

Fourth: “It wasn't on the left, it was on the right!”

Second: “You fool, it was on the left.”

Fourth: “Just because you say so, that makes it on the left?”

Second: “If it wasn't on the left, then that pond—”

Udayaditya: “Yes, my boy, it does seem it was on the left.
Please continue.”

Second: “Yes, sir!
He led us through that mango grove on the left and into a field.
We crossed so many ploughed fields, marshlands, and bamboo thickets, but there wasn't a trace of any village.
After wandering like this for three hours, just as we neared a village, we couldn't find where that scoundrel had fled.”

First: “I didn't have a good feeling about that fellow from the moment I saw him.”

Second: “I also thought something like this was bound to happen.”

Third: “The moment I saw he was a Nere, I grew suspicious!”

In the end, they all declared that they had understood everything from the very beginning.

## Chapter 5

Pratapaditya said, “Look here, Minister, those two Pathans have not yet arrived!”
The minister said slowly, “That is not my fault, Maharaj!”
Pratapaditya said irritably, “This is not about fault.
There must be a reason for the delay, mustn't there?
I am asking what you surmise.”
Minister: “Simultali is a great distance from here.
It is expected there would be a delay in going, completing the task, and returning.”
Pratapaditya was displeased with the minister’s words.
He wanted the minister to surmise the same thing he was surmising.
But the minister did not go in that direction.
Pratapaditya said, “Did Udayaditya go out last night?”
Minister: “Yes, Your Majesty, I have already informed you of that.”
Pratapaditya: “‘I have already informed you’!
And what a timely moment you chose to inform me.
Do you think your job is finished as long as you inform me at some point?
Udayaditya was not like this before.
The daughter of the Shripur landlord must have given him ill counsel.
What do you think?”
Minister: “How can I say, Maharaj?”
Pratapaditya exclaimed, “Am I asking you for absolute truth?
Just tell me what you guess!”
Minister: “You hear everything about the young mistress from the Mahishi.
You are in the best position to guess in this matter, how could I possibly guess?”
A Pathan entered the room.
Pratapaditya cried out, “What happened?
Is the job settled?”
Pathan: “Yes, Maharaj, it is settled by now.”
Pratapaditya: “What kind of answer is that?
So you don’t know for sure?”
Pathan: “Yes, Your Majesty, I do know.
The job is settled, there is no doubt about it, but I was not present at the time.”
Pratapaditya: “Then how was the job settled?”
Pathan: “As per your advice, I was leading his men away when I left.
Hosen Khan has finished the job.”
Pratapaditya: “And what if he has not?”
Pathan: “Maharaj, I stake my head on it.”
Pratapaditya: “Very well, wait right there.
You will receive your reward when your brother returns.”
The Pathan stood at a distance near the door, in the custody of the guards.
After remaining silent for a long time, Pratapaditya said slowly to the minister, “We must try to ensure that the subjects do not find out about this in any way.”
The minister said, “Maharaj, if you will not be displeased, I must say that this will certainly be revealed.”
Pratapaditya: “How do you know that?”
Minister: “Previously, you have openly expressed animosity towards your paternal uncle.
You did not invite Basanta Ray to your daughter’s wedding; he came on his own, uninvited.
Today, you suddenly invited him for no reason, and someone killed him on the road.
Under these circumstances, the subjects will know you to be the root of this incident.”
Pratapaditya said angrily, “I cannot understand your attitude at all, Minister!
It is as if you would be happy if this news got out, as if your heart’s desire would be fulfilled if my name were slandered.
Otherwise, why do you keep saying day and night that the matter will surely be revealed?
I see no reason for it to be revealed.
I suppose if the news doesn't spread by any other means, you yourself will go door to door and announce it!”
The minister said, “Maharaj, pardon me.
You understand all matters much better than I do.
For a person of humble intellect like me to offer you counsel is an act of great audacity.
However, since you yourself have chosen and kept me as your minister, it is with this courage that I occasionally tell you what comes to my humble mind.
If you are angered by my counsel, then please relieve this servant of his duties.”
Pratapaditya straightened up.
Occasionally, when the minister told him a few hard truths, Pratapaditya was inwardly pleased.
Pratapaditya said, “I am considering that if I have those two Pathans killed, there will be no further cause for fear in this matter.”
The minister said, “Covering up one murder is a burden enough; managing three murders is impossible.
The subjects will surely find out.”
The minister stood by his own words.
Pratapaditya exclaimed, “Then I am overcome with fear!
The subjects will find out!
Jessore is not Raigarh; the subjects do not rule here.
Here, besides the king, everyone else is not the king.
Therefore, do not try to scare me with the subjects.
If any subject utters a word against me in this matter, I will burn his tongue with a hot iron.”
The minister smiled to himself.
He thought to himself, “So much fear of the subjects' tongues.
And yet he consoles his mind that he fears no subject!”

Pratapaditya.
“After the funeral rites are over, I must go to Raigarh with my men.
I see no other heir to the throne there but myself.”

The elderly Basanta Ray slowly entered the room.
Pratapaditya, startled, staggered back.
Suddenly, he thought it must be an apparition.
Stunned, he could not utter a single word.
Basanta Ray went near him, placed a hand on his arm, and said in a soft voice, “What is there to fear in me, Pratap?
I am your paternal uncle.
If even that does not reassure you, I am an old man; I have no power to harm you.”

Pratapaditya had come to his senses, but he was utterly inept at fabricating a story.
He remained silent, standing there in astonishment.
He did not even manage to bow to his uncle in respect.

Basanta Ray spoke again, slowly, “Pratap, say something, anything.
If by chance you have done something that makes you feel shame and hesitation at seeing me, then do not worry about it.
I will not bring up the matter.
Come, my child; let us embrace.
We are seeing each other after a long time, and we will not see each other for much longer.”

After all this time, Pratapaditya finally bowed and, rising, embraced his uncle.
In the meantime, the minister had quietly slipped out of the room.
With a faint, gentle smile, Basanta Ray placed a hand on Pratapaditya’s arm and said, “Basanta Ray has lived a long time, has he not, Pratap?
My time has come.
Vidhat alone knows why the call hasn't come yet.
But there is not much delay left.”

Basanta Ray remained silent for a moment; Pratapaditya gave no reply.
Basanta Ray spoke again, “Then let me say everything clearly.
That you raised a knife to me has wounded me more than the knife itself.”
(As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes.)
“But I am not angry in the least.
I will only say two things to you.
Do not kill me, Pratap!
It will bring you no good in this life or the next.
If you could wait for my death all this time, can you not wait just a couple more days?
Will you become a sinner for this little thing?”

Basanta Ray saw that Pratapaditya gave no answer; he neither denied the charge nor expressed any remorse.
He immediately changed the subject, saying, “Pratap, come to Raigarh for a visit.
You have not been there for a long time.
You will see many changes.
The soldiers have now traded their swords for ploughs; where the soldiers' barracks were, there is now a guesthouse for travelers—”

Just then, Pratapaditya saw from a distance that the Pathan was preparing to flee.
He could restrain himself no longer.
The suppressed rage seething within him erupted like a volcano.
He roared in a voice like thunder, “Don't you dare let him go!
Seize and hold him!”
Saying this, he strode swiftly out of the room.

The King summoned the minister and said, “I have noticed your extreme inattention to royal duties.”

The minister said softly, “Maharaj, I am not at fault in this matter.”

Pratapaditya thundered, “Am I referring to any specific matter!
I am saying, I have noticed your extreme inattention to royal duties.
The other day, I gave you a letter to keep, and you lost it!”

Indeed, such an incident had occurred a month and a half ago, but at the time, the Maharaj had not said a single word to the minister.

“And another day I ordered you to go to Umesh Ray, but you sent a man and finished the work!
Be quiet!
Do not make useless attempts to excuse your fault!
In any case, I am informing you that you are paying no attention whatsoever to royal duties.”

The King summoned the guards.
He had docked the pay of the previous night's guards; now he sentenced them to imprisonment.

Going to the inner quarters, he summoned the Mahishi and said, “Mahishi!
I see extreme disorder within the royal family!
Udayaditya was never like this before.
Now he goes out whenever he pleases.
He involves himself in the affairs of the subjects.
He acts against my wishes.
What is the meaning of all this?”

The Mahishi said fearfully, “Maharaj, he is not to blame!
The root of all this trouble is that elder daughter-in-law!
My child was not like this before.
From the day he was married into the house of Shripur, Uday has become so different, I can’t understand it at all.”

The Maharaj ordered Surma to be kept under control and went outside.
The Mahishi sent for Udayaditya.
When Udayaditya arrived, she looked at his face and said, “Alas, my child has become thin and pale!
What a complexion my boy had before his marriage!
Like molten gold!
Who brought you to this state?
My son, do not listen to what that elder daughter-in-law tells you.
It is from listening to her words that you have come to this state.”
Surma stood silently to one side, her face veiled.
The Mahishi continued, “She is of lowly birth, is she worthy of you?
Does she know how to advise you?
I am speaking the truth, she never gives you good advice—it is as if she thrives on your misfortune!
To think the Maharaj had you married to such a demoness!”
The Mahishi began to shed tears.

Beads of sweat appeared on Udayaditya’s calm forehead.
Lest the turmoil in his mind be revealed, he turned his large eyes away.

An old, elderly maidservant who was sitting there waved her hand and exclaimed, “The women of Shripur know magic.
She has surely given our child a potion.”
Saying this, she got up, went to Udayaditya, and said, “My son, she has bewitched you with a potion.
That girl you see, she is no ordinary girl!
A girl from the house of Shripur.
They are witches!
Alas, has she left anything of my child’s health?”
With this, she shot a glance like an arrow towards Surma and, with her sari, rubbed both her dry eyes with both hands until they turned red.
Seeing this, the Mahishi’s sorrow welled up all over again.
A contagion of weeping spread among the old women of the inner quarters.
With the intention of crying, they all gathered in the queen’s room.
Udayaditya glanced once at Surma’s face with compassionate eyes.
Through her veil, Surma saw it, and wiping her eyes, she left for her room slowly, without uttering a word.

In the evening, the Mahishi said to Pratapaditya, “Today I explained everything to Uday.
My child is not like that.
He understands when things are explained to him.
Today, his eyes have been opened.”

## Chapter 6

Seeing Vibha’s sullen face, Surma could remain silent no longer.
Putting an arm around her neck, she said, “Vibha, why are you so quiet?
Why don't you say what is on your mind?”

Vibha replied softly, “What more is there for me to say?”

Surma said, “You haven’t seen him in a long time; it’s only natural that you miss him!
Why don’t you write him a letter asking him to come?
I will arrange for your brother to send it.”

The conversation concerned Vibha’s husband, Ramchandra Ray, the ruler of Chandradwip.

Lowering her head, Vibha began to speak.
“If no one here respects him, if no one deems it necessary to summon him, then it is better he does not come.
If he were to come of his own accord, I would forbid it.
He is a king; why should he come to a place where he is not honored?
In what way is he inferior to us that Father should insult him?”
As she spoke, Vibha could no longer control herself; her face flushed red, and she burst into tears.

Surma drew Vibha’s face to her breast and, wiping her tears, said, “Alright, Vibha, if you were a man, what would you do?
Would you refuse to go to your father-in-law’s house just because you didn’t receive an invitation?”

Vibha cried out, “No, I couldn't do that.
If I were a man, I would go at once; I wouldn't think of honor or insult.
But that doesn’t mean he should come unless he is invited with affection and respect!”

Vibha had never spoken so much at once.
Today, overcome with emotion, she had said a great deal.
Now, she began to feel a little embarrassed.
I've said too much, she thought.
And the way I said it is so mortifying!
Gradually, her emotional turmoil subsided, and a heavy gloom slowly settled upon her.
Hiding her face in her arm, Vibha laid her head in Surma’s lap.
Surma bent down and began to gently run her fingers through Vibha's thick hair.
A long time passed like this.
Neither of them spoke a word.
Tears fell, one by one, from Vibha’s eyes, and Surma gently wiped them away.

After a long time, as evening fell, Vibha slowly sat up, wiped her tears, and smiled slightly.
The meaning of that smile was— “What childishness I have displayed today!”

Gradually, she turned her face away and began to make an attempt to slip away.
Surma, without a word, held her hand.
Without bringing up their earlier conversation, she said, “Vibha, have you heard?
Grand-uncle has arrived.”

Vibha.
“Grand-uncle has arrived?”

Surma.
“Yes.”

Vibha asked with eagerness, “When did he arrive?”

Surma.
“Around the fourth prahar of the day.”

Vibha.
“But he still hasn't come to see us.”

A slight sense of hurt arose in Vibha’s heart.
Vibha was extremely protective of her claim on her grand-uncle.
In fact, one day Basanta Ray had spoken with Udayaditya for a long time and made Vibha wait in the inner quarters for three dandas without coming to see her at all; Vibha had been so distressed by this that, although she said nothing about it, she could not speak to her grand-uncle with a cheerful face.

Entering the room, Basanta Ray began to sing with a laugh;—

“Today I've come to see you after many long days!

Have no fear, be happy,

I won't stay for long,

I've come for just a short while!

I'll only see your face,

Hear a few sweet words,

And after seeing your smile from afar, I'll go off to another land!”

Hearing the song, Vibha lowered her face and smiled.
She was very delighted.
She felt flustered, lest her great delight be discovered.

Surma lifted Vibha's face and said, “Grand-uncle, you didn't have to go into hiding to see Vibha's smile, did you?”

Basanta Ray.
“No. Vibha thought, ‘If the old man won't leave unless I smile, then I might as well smile a little.’
I understand this witch's intentions perfectly—it's a trick to get rid of me!
But that's not happening so soon.
If I've come, I'll torment you properly, so you'll remember me until we meet again!”

Surma laughed and said, “Look Grand-uncle, Vibha whispered in my ear that if your intention is to be remembered, then the torment you've already caused is quite enough; there's no need to start afresh.”

Hearing this, Basanta Ray was greatly amused.
He began to laugh.

Embarrassed, Vibha exclaimed, “No, I never said that!
I didn't say anything at all.”

Surma said, “Grand-uncle, your wish has been fulfilled!
You wanted to see a smile, and you saw it.
You wanted to hear her speak, and I made you hear it.
So now, you can go off to another land.”

Basanta Ray.
“No, my dear, I can't do that!
I've brought about fifteen songs and a head full of grey hair, and I can't leave until I've presented them all!”

Vibha could no longer contain herself; she laughed out loud and said, “But you have barely half a head of hair, Grand-uncle!”

The grand-uncle's scheme was successful.
It takes some effort to get Vibha to open up in conversation after a long time, but once she starts talking to her grand-uncle, it takes even more effort to make her stop.
However, Vibha never opens up like this to anyone else, under any circumstances.

Stroking his bald head, Basanta Ray said, “Ah, those days are gone, my dear!
When Basanta Ray had a full head of hair, do you think I would have walked all this way to flatter you?
If a single hair turned grey, five beauties like you would have been candidates to pluck it, and in their eagerness, they would have plucked out ten black ones as well!”

Vibha asked in a serious tone, “Tell me, Grand-uncle, when you had a full head of hair, did you look better than you do now?”

In her mind, Vibha had grave doubts about this.
She tried to mentally change her grand-uncle’s bald pate, his broad smile on lips untouched by a mustache, his mellow, ripe-mango-like demeanor, but it didn't seem right at all.
She saw that her grand-uncle simply wouldn't look right without his bald head.
And adding a mustache would make his face look absolutely awful.
So awful, in fact, that she couldn't keep from smiling when she imagined it.
Her grand-uncle with a mustache!
Her grand-uncle without a bald head!

Basanta Ray said, “There are many differences of opinion on that matter.
My granddaughters are captivated by my bald head; they have never seen my hair.
My grandmothers were captivated by my abundant hair; they had never seen my bald head.
Those who have seen both have not yet been able to make up their minds.”

Vibha said, “But still, Grand-uncle, if you were to become any balder than you already are, it wouldn't look good!”

Surma said, “Dadamahashay, we can discuss your baldness later.
For now, you must find a solution for Vibha!”

Vibha quickly went up to Basanta Ray and exclaimed, “Dadamahashay—let me pluck your grey hairs.”

Surma: “What I was saying is—”

Vibha: “Listen, Dadamahashay, your—”

Surma: “Vibha, be quiet.
What I was saying is, if you would just go once—”

Vibha: “Dadamahashay, there is nothing but grey hair on your head!
If I pluck them, you will go completely bald!”

Basanta Ray: “If you won't let me listen, Didi, if you keep bothering me, then I shall begin to play Raag Hindol.”

Saying this, he began to twist the tuning pegs of his small sitar.
Vibha had a particular dislike for Raag Hindol.

Vibha said, “What a disaster!
In that case, I'm fleeing,” and went out of the room.

Then Surma, becoming serious, said, “If he knew the pain Vibha carries in her heart day and night in silence, I believe even the Maharaja's heart would feel pity!”

“Why!
Why!
What has happened to her!” saying this, Basanta Ray went and sat near Surma with great eagerness.

Surma said, “Does no one even remember to send an invitation to her husband for a single day in the year?”

Basanta Ray, after thinking, said, “That's true indeed!”

Surma said, “Tell me, how many women can bear such disrespect towards their husband?
Vibha is a good soul, so she says nothing to anyone; she hides it in her heart and weeps.”

Basanta Ray, becoming distressed, exclaimed, “She hides it in her heart and weeps?”

Surma: “She was weeping so much with me this afternoon.”

Basanta Ray: “Vibha was weeping this afternoon?”

Surma: “Yes!”

Basanta Ray: “Alas, call her here at once, let me see her!”

Surma brought Vibha to him.
Basanta Ray took her by the chin and said, “Why are you crying, Didi?
When you are in any trouble, why don’t you tell your Dada Mahashay?
Then I could do what I can, couldn’t I?
I’ll go right now and tell Pratap!”

Vibha cried out, “Dada Mahashay, I fall at your feet, please don’t say anything to Father about me.
Dada Mahashay, I fall at your feet, don’t go!”

Saying this, Basanta Ray went out.
He went to Pratapaditya and said, “You have not invited your son-in-law for a long time, which shows extreme neglect towards him.
If the son-in-law of the Lord of Jessore is not shown as much respect as he deserves, then the dishonor is yours.
There is no glory in it at all.”

Pratapaditya did not object in the slightest to his uncle’s words.
The order was given to send an invitation letter with an entourage to Chandradwip.

Returning to Vibha and Surma in the women's quarters, a flurry of sitar playing began from Basanta Ray.

“Let a smile bloom on this sad face, and soothe these two eyes!”

Embarrassed, Vibha said, “Dada Mahashay, did you tell Father everything about me?”

Basanta Ray continued to sing,

“Let a smile bloom on this sad face, and soothe these two eyes.

Shed your dreary clothes, my friend, and wear your jewels.”

Vibha placed a hand on the sitar's strings to silence it and asked again, “Did you tell Father about me?”

Just then, Udayaditya’s youngest brother, eight-year-old Samaraditya, peeked into the room and exclaimed, “Aha, Didi!
Gossiping with Dada Mahashay!
I’m going to tell Mother on you.”

“Come, come, brother, come!” said Basanta Ray, catching hold of him.

The royal family believed that Basanta Ray and Surma together had brought about Udayaditya’s ruin.
For this reason, whenever Basanta Ray arrived, everyone would go on high alert.
Samaraditya began to pull and tug to free himself from Basanta Ray’s grasp.
But by giving him the sitar, putting him on his shoulders, and letting him wear his spectacles, Basanta Ray had so charmed him within moments that the boy followed his Dada Mahashay around all day, constantly strumming the sitar, breaking five of its strings, and snatching away the mezrab, which he refused to give back!

## Chapter 7

King Ramchandra Ray of Chandradwip was seated in his royal chamber.
The room was octagonal.
A fabric-wrapped chandelier hung from the rafters.
In one of the wall niches stood an idol of Ganesh, and in the others were various images of Shri Krishna in different poses.
They were handcrafted by the famous artisan Batakrishna Kumbhakar.
Sheets were spread all around, and in the center was a muslin mattress embroidered with gold thread, upon which lay a bolster and a cushion.
Its four corners had gold-thread tassels.
Indigenous mirrors, in which one's face could not be seen clearly, hung on the walls.
In the human mirrors surrounding the king, he couldn't see his face clearly either; his physical form appeared greatly magnified.
To the king’s left were a huge hookah and the minister, Harishankar.
To the king's right were Ramai the jester, and the bespectacled general, Fernandez.

The king said, “Well, Ramai!”

Ramai replied, “Yes, Your Majesty!”

The king was convulsed with laughter.
The minister laughed even harder than the king.
Fernandez clapped his hands and burst out laughing.
Ramai’s eyes twinkled with satisfaction.
The king thought that not laughing at Ramai's words would show a lack of refinement; the minister thought it was his duty to laugh when the king laughed; Fernandez thought there must be something to laugh at.
Besides, if any unfortunate soul happened not to laugh when Ramai opened his mouth, Ramai would make him cry before letting him go.
Otherwise, few people would laugh in genuine amusement at Ramai’s jokes, which were as old as time.
However, out of fear and a sense of duty, everyone from the king down to the doorman would force a terrible laugh.

The king asked, “What’s the news?”

Ramai thought it necessary to be witty.

“Rumor has it that a thief broke into the esteemed general’s house.”

The general grew restless.
He understood that an old story was being trotted out at his expense.
As much as he dreaded Ramai’s wit, Ramai would target him every single time.
The king found it highly amusing!
The moment Ramai arrived, he would send for Fernandez.
There were two main amusements in the king's life: one was watching ram fights, and the other was placing Fernandez before Ramai’s mouth.
Ever since entering the king's service, the general had not suffered the graze of a bullet or the scratch of an arrow.
But from the constant volley of laughter-laced cannonballs, the man was always on the verge of tears.
Readers will forgive us, but we cannot record all of Ramai’s witticisms; for the sake of good taste, most of them must be omitted.

The king winked and asked, “And then?”

“I submit, Your Majesty!
(Fernandez began to unbutton and button his tunic.)
For the last three or four days, a thief had been frequenting the general’s house at night.
The Saheb’s wife found out and prodded her husband many times, but she could not wake him by any means.”

King: “Ha, ha, ha, ha.”

Minister: “Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.”

General: “Hee, hee.”

“During the day, unable to bear his wife’s nagging any longer, he said with folded hands, ‘I beg you, I will catch the thief tonight.’
Around two dandas into the night, the wife said, ‘Hey, the thief is here!’
The husband said, ‘Oh, drat, the lamp is lit in the room!
The thief will see us, and as soon as he sees us, he’ll run away.’
He called out to the thief, ‘You got very lucky today.
The lamp is lit, so you can escape safely.
Let’s see you come back tomorrow; we’ll see how you avoid getting caught in the dark.’”

King: “Ha ha ha ha!”

Minister: “Hohohohoho!”

General: “Hee.”

The king said, “And then?”

Ramai saw that the king was not yet satisfied.
“I don’t know why, but the thief wasn't scared enough.
He came again the next night.
The wife said, ‘We’re ruined, get up!’
The husband said, ‘Why don’t you get up?’
The wife said, ‘What will I do if I get up?’
The husband said, ‘Why, just light a lamp in the room!
I can’t see a thing!’
The wife was furious; the husband, even more enraged, said, ‘See, everything is lost because of you!
Light the lamp and bring the gun!’
Meanwhile, the thief, having finished his work, said, ‘Sir, could you offer me a pipeful of tobacco?
I’m very tired.’
The husband gave him a fierce scolding, saying, ‘Wait, you rascal!
I am preparing the tobacco for you.
But if you come near me, I’ll blow your head off with this gun.’
After smoking the tobacco, the thief said, ‘Sir, it would be a help if you lit the lamp.
I’ve dropped my housebreaking tool and can’t find it.’
The general said, ‘The rascal is scared.
Stay back, don’t come near.’
Saying this, he quickly lit the lamp.
Taking his time, the thief packed up his things and left.
The husband said to his wife, ‘The rascal was terribly frightened.’”

The king and the minister couldn't contain their laughter.
Fernandez, every now and then, managed to drag out fragmented chuckles, “Hee, hee.”

The King said, “Ramai, have you heard I am going to my father-in-law’s house?”

Pulling a face, Ramai said, “Asarang khalu sansarang, sarang shvashurmandirang.
(Laughter.
First the King, then the minister, then the general.)
The saying is not false.
(Sighing deeply) Everything about the father-in-law’s house is essential—the food, the hospitality; you get the cream of the milk, you get the head of the fish; all are substantial things.
The only thing that is utterly worthless is that wife!”

The King laughed and said, “What is this?
She is your better half—”

Ramai, with folded hands, said anxiously, “Maharaj, please do not call her my better half.
If I perform penance for three lifetimes, perhaps one day I might have the good fortune to become *her* better half.
Even if you join five ‘better halves’ like me, it would not match her size!”
(Laughter in sequence.)
Everyone else understood the joke, except the minister, which is precisely why he had to laugh the loudest of all.

The King said, “But I have heard your wife is very gentle-natured and especially skilled in household duties.”

Ramai said, “What’s the use of that talk!
The house has every kind of junk, only I can’t seem to stay.
Every dawn, my wife sweeps in such a way that I land right at the Maharaj’s doorstep.”

Here, in this context, let me introduce Ramai’s wife.
She is extremely thin and is growing thinner by the day.
When Ramai comes home, she doesn’t know where to hide.
In the royal court, Ramai shows his teeth in one way, and when he comes home to his wife, he shows his teeth in another.
But because describing his wife’s true state would evoke pathos instead of humor, Ramai describes her in court as obese and ferocious, and the King and his ministers cannot contain their laughter!

When the laughter subsided, the King said, “Well Ramai, you will have to go, and I shall take the general with me as well.”

The general understood that Ramai was about to launch a second attack on him.
He lifted his spectacles onto his eyes and began to unbutton and button his coat.

Ramai said, “The general can have no objection to going to a place of festivity, because this is not a battlefield!”

The King and the minister thought a great joke was coming; they asked eagerly, “Why?”

Ramai replied, “The general has spectacles fixed on his eyes day and night.
He even wears them to sleep, otherwise he can't dream properly.
The general has no other objection to going to war, except for the fear that a cannonball might strike the glass of his spectacles, shattering the glass and blinding his eye!
Isn't that right, sir?”

The general winked and said, “What else could it be?”
He rose from his seat and said, “Maharaj, if you command, may I take my leave?”

The King told the general to prepare for the journey.
“Make all the arrangements for the departure.
See that my sixty-four-oar boat is ready.”
The minister and the general departed.

The king said, “Ramai, you have heard everything.
Last time at my father-in-law’s house, they had utterly humiliated me, hadn't they?”

Ramai replied, “Yes, Your Majesty, they gave you a tail.”

The king laughed, and though his teeth flashed like lightning, a great cloud gathered in his mind.
He was not very pleased to hear that Ramai had learned of this news.
It would not have been so damaging had anyone else known.
He began to puff incessantly on his hookah.

Ramai said, “One of your brothers-in-law came and told me that your king’s tail was revealed in the nuptial chamber.
Is he Ramchandra, or Ramdas?
I never knew that before.”
I immediately replied, “How could you have known before?
It didn’t exist before.
He has come to marry into your house, so he has adopted the custom of the country.”

The king was overjoyed to hear this reply!
He felt that through Ramai, his own honor and that of his ancestors had been vindicated, and that Pratapaditya’s ‘aditya’ (sun) had been completely and forever eclipsed by Rahu.
The king did not much care for wars and battles.
He viewed these small incidents as being as terribly significant as wars and battles.
Until now, his perception had been that he had suffered a terribly humiliating defeat.
The thought of this disgrace was on his mind day and night, and in his shame, he wished the earth would swallow him whole.
Today, his mind found much solace in the fact that General Ramai had returned victorious from the battle.
But nevertheless, the burden of shame had not been completely lifted from his mind.

The king said to Ramai, “Ramai, this time you must go and win.
If you are victorious, I will gift you my ring.”

Ramai said, “Maharaj, why worry about victory?
If you can get me into the inner quarters, I can make a complete fool of even the queen mother herself, to my heart’s content.”

The king said, “Is that a concern?
I will take you into the inner quarters myself.”

Ramai said, “What is impossible for you?”

This was also the king’s belief.
What could he not do?
If one of his devoted followers said, “Victory to the Maharaj, fulfill this servant’s wish,” his great majesty Ramchandra Ray would immediately say, “Yes, it shall be so.”
He would have no one think there was any task he could not perform.
He decided he would take Ramai Bhand into Pratapaditya’s inner quarters and have him mock the queen mother herself; only then would he be worthy of the name King Ramchandra Ray.
If he could not accomplish such a great and noble deed, then what kind of king was he?

The lord of Chandradwip sent for Rammohan Mal.
Rammohan Mal was like Bhim in prowess.
He was nearly four and a half cubits tall.
Muscles rippled all over his body.
He was a man from the time of the late king.
He had raised Ramchandra from childhood.
Everyone feared Ramai, but if Ramai feared anyone, it was this Rammohan.
Rammohan despised Ramai immensely.
Under his disdainful gaze, Ramai would somehow shrink into himself.
If he could avoid Rammohan's gaze, he would not spare him.
Rammohan came and stood.
The king said that fifty retainers would go with him, and Rammohan would be their leader.

Rammohan said, “As you command.
But will Ramai Thakur be going?”
The cat-eyed, short-statured Ramai Thakur shrank back.

## Chapter 8

The staff at the Jessore palace were very busy today.
The son-in-law was coming, and various preparations had to be made.
Extensive arrangements for food were underway.
Although there was no difference of opinion between Pratapaditya and the Mahishi that the royal family of Chandradwip was utterly insignificant compared to Jessore's, she was nevertheless extremely delighted that her son-in-law was coming.
From the morning, she began dressing Vibha with her own hands—and Vibha found herself in a terrible predicament.
This was because, regarding the method of adornment, there were many differences in taste between the aged mother and the young daughter, but what could be done?
The Mahishi, of course, understood best what was good for Vibha.
Vibha had imagined that three thin, turquoise-colored bangles on each of her fair, delicate hands would be very becoming;—the Mahishi made her wear eight thick gold bangles and one huge diamond bracelet on each arm and became so pleased that she sent for all the elderly maidservants and widowed aunts in the house to show them.
Vibha knew that a nose ring would not suit her small, delicate face at all—but the Mahishi made her wear a large one and, turning her face once to the right and once to the left, observed her with pride.
Vibha remained silent even through this, but the way the Mahishi styled her hair became absolutely unbearable for her.
She secretly went to Surma and had her hair done to her own liking.
But it did not escape the Mahishi's notice.
The Mahishi saw that Vibha’s entire look was ruined simply by the flawed hairstyle.
She clearly perceived that Surma, out of jealousy, had purposely ruined Vibha's hair;—she tried to open Vibha's eyes to Surma's base intentions;—after scolding for a long time, when she was certain she had succeeded, she undid her hair and styled it again!
Thus, Vibha, carrying the burden of her coiffure, her nose ring, her arms full of bangles, and a heart full of joy, became utterly flustered.
She realized that she could in no way keep her unruly glee confined within the inner quarters; it kept peeking out from her eyes and face like flashes of lightning.
She felt as if even the walls of the house were ready to mock her.
Yubaraj Udayaditya came and saw Vibha’s shy, joyous face with deep, affectionate, and serene delight.
He was so happy to see Vibha’s joy that he went to his room and, with an affectionate, gentle smile, kissed Surma.

Surma asked, “What is it?”

Udayaditya replied, “Nothing at all!”

Just then, Basanta Ray forcibly dragged Vibha into the room.
Holding her chin and lifting her face, he said, “Look, Dada, just look at your Vibha’s face today!
Surma,—oh
Surma, come and see!”
The old man laughed, his voice choked with joy.
Looking at Vibha's face, he said, “If you are so happy, why not laugh properly, my dear, let me see!”

“How can you hold laughter captive at your feet?
Its heart’s desire is to play upon those lips!”

“If my age hadn't passed, seeing that face of yours today, I would have fallen here and died!
Alas, alas, the age for dying is gone!
In my youth, I would die at every moment.
In old age, one doesn't get to die unless there's an illness!”

When his brother-in-law came and asked Pratapaditya, “Who has gone to welcome our dear son-in-law?” he replied, “How should I know!”

“Surely the path must be lit today?”

Widening his eyes, the Maharaja said, “There is no rule that it absolutely must be!”

Then the king’s brother-in-law hesitantly said, “Will the Nabat not be played?”

“I have no time to think about all that.”

The truth is, bringing a son-in-law home with musical fanfare was not Pratapaditya's kind of work.

Ramchandra Ray was overcome with great offense.
He decided that he had been deliberately insulted.
On previous occasions, men had been sent from the royal palace to Chakdihi to receive him; this time, it was only after he had passed Chakdihi and traveled two krosh further that the Dewanji came to welcome him at Bamanhati.
And even if the Dewanji did come, he brought no more than two hundred and fifty men with him.
Why, could not another fifty men be found in all of Jessore?
According to Ramai Bhand, the portly Dewanji himself was larger than the elephant that had been sent to carry the king.
Ramai had asked the Dewan, “Sir, is that creature perhaps your younger brother?”

The good-natured Dewanji, slightly astonished, had replied, “No, that is an elephant.”

The king, aggrieved, said to the Dewan, “Even the elephant that your minister rides is larger than this one.”

The Dewan replied, “The large elephants have been sent far away on royal business; there isn’t a single one in the city.”

Ramchandra concluded that they had been sent away deliberately to insult him.
What other reason could there be!

King of Kings Ramchandra Ray, his face flushed, uttered his father-in-law's name and exclaimed, “In what way am I lesser than Pratapaditya Ray?”

Ramai Bhand quipped, “In age and in relation, what else?
The very fact that you married his daughter, that itself—"

Rammohan Mal was standing nearby.
He could bear it no longer and, becoming terribly angry, burst out, “Look, Thakur, you have grown far too bold.
Do not speak of my Mathakrun in that manner.
I am telling you this plainly.”

Targeting Pratapaditya, Ramai said, “I have seen plenty of 'Adityas' like him.
Don't you know, Maharaj, that the one who can hold an Aditya under his arm is a slave to Ramchandra.”

The king smiled, suppressing his laughter.
Rammohan then took slow steps to stand before the king and, with joined hands, said, “Maharaj, I cannot bear it that this Bamna says whatever he pleases in your father-in-law's name.
If you command, I will shut his mouth.”

The king said, “Rammohan, you be quiet.”

Rammohan then walked far away from that place.

That day, after considering a thousand minute details, Ramchandra concluded that Pratapaditya had long been making extensive preparations to insult him.
He was utterly swollen with wounded pride.
He resolved to assume such a demeanor before Pratapaditya that Pratapaditya would understand just how great a man his son-in-law was.

When Ramchandra met with Pratapaditya, the latter was seated in his royal chamber with his minister.
As soon as he saw Pratapaditya, Ramchandra slowly approached with his head bowed and paid his respects.

Without showing the slightest joy or haste, Pratapaditya said calmly, “Come.
Are you well?”

Ramchandra replied in a low voice, “Yes, sir.”

Turning to his minister, Pratapaditya said, “Have you made any inquiries into the complaint that has come against the tax collector of the Bhangamathi pargana?”

The minister produced a long document and handed it to the king, who began to read.
After reading a short way, he glanced up at his son-in-law and asked, “You didn't have floods at your place this year like the last, did you?”

Ramchandra began, “No, sir.
In the month of Ashvin, the water level did rise—”

Pratapaditya interrupted, “Minister, a copy of this letter has surely been kept,” and resumed his reading.
When he had finished, he told his son-in-law, “Go now, my boy, to the inner quarters.”

Ramchandra rose slowly.
He now understood in what way Pratapaditya was superior to him.

## Chapter 9

When Rammohan Mal entered the inner quarters, bowed to Vibha, and said, “Ma, I came to see you for a moment,” Vibha’s heart filled with great delight.
She was very fond of Rammohan.
Carrying the various burdens of his duties as a relative, Rammohan would often come from Chandradwip to Jessore.
Even when there was no need, he would come to see Vibha whenever he had a chance.
Vibha felt no shyness with Rammohan.
When the old, strong, tall Rammohan would stand before her calling her “Ma,” there was such a pure, simple, unadorned affection in him that Vibha felt like a mere child in his presence.
Vibha asked him, “Mohan, why haven’t you come in so long?”

Rammohan replied, “Well, Ma, ‘a son may be a bad son, but a mother is never a bad mother.’
When did you ever think of me?
I told myself, I will not go unless Ma calls for me; let’s see how long it takes for her to remember!
But alas, you didn’t remember me even once!”

Vibha found herself in a great fix.
She couldn’t properly explain why she hadn’t called.
Besides, she felt there was a flaw somewhere in the logic of his statement that not calling him meant she hadn’t thought of him, yet she couldn’t quite articulate it.

Seeing Vibha’s predicament, Rammohan laughed and said, “No, Ma, I couldn’t come because I didn’t have the time.”

Vibha said, “Mohan, sit down; tell me stories of your land.”

Rammohan sat.
He began to describe Chandradwip.
With her hand on her cheek, Vibha listened with rapt attention.
As she heard the description of Chandradwip, so many fantasies awakened in her little heart; the number of castles she built in the sky that day was beyond count.
When Rammohan told the story of how, during last year's monsoon flood, his entire house was washed away; how just before dusk, he alone, carrying his elderly mother on his back, had swum to the spire of a temple, and how the two of them had spent the entire night there—what a tremor went through Vibha’s small chest.

When the story was over, Rammohan said, “Ma, I have brought four conch shell bangles for you.
You must wear them on those hands, and I will watch.”

Vibha took off her four gold bangles and put on the shell ones.
She then went to her mother, smiling, and said, “Ma, Mohan has taken off your bangles and made me wear these four shell bangles.”

Far from being displeased, the Mahishi laughed and said, “Well, it’s a fine adornment, it suits you very well.”

Rammohan became extremely encouraged and proud.
The Mahishi had him summoned and personally supervised his meal.
After he had eaten to his heart’s content, she was very pleased and said, “Mohan, now sing that Agamani song of yours.”
Looking at Vibha, Rammohan sang;

“I haven’t seen you all year, Ma, what kind of mother are you?

Losing the star of my eye, my pupils have gone blind!

Have you come, O stone-hearted one?

I want to fill my eyes with the sight of you,

For nothing can stop, Ma, this wretched stream from my eyes!”

Tears came to Rammohan’s eyes, and the Mahishi, looking at Vibha’s face, also wiped away her tears.
The Agamani song reminded her of Vijaya.

Gradually, evening descended.
The crowd of palace ladies began to grow.
Neighboring women gathered in the inner quarters to see the son-in-law and, as per their relationship, to tease him.
Joy, shyness, apprehension, a vague, uncertain feeling of ‘what-is-going-to-happen’ churned in Vibha’s heart.
Her face and ears turned red, and her hands and feet grew cold.
Who knows if this was pain or pleasure!

The son-in-law had entered the inner quarters.
The women, like a swarm of stinging beauties, attacked him from all sides.
A clamor of laughter arose all around.
From every direction, a sharp mockery from cuckoo-throats, harsh blows from lotus-stalk arms, and the sharp pinching of champak-fingers' moon-like nails commenced.
Just as Ramchandra Ray had become utterly overwhelmed, a middle-aged woman came and took his side.
She began to speak such cutting words in a harsh voice, and gradually such vulgarities began to emerge from her mouth that the palace ladies were more or less silenced.
Even Thakdidi fell silent before her.
Vimaladidi got up and left the room.
Only Bhuto’s mother gave her a piece of her mind.
While the aforementioned Bhuto’s mother’s mouth was running at full tilt, the middle-aged woman said to her, “My goodness, that’s not a mouth you have, it’s a whole broom!”
Bhuto’s mother retorted at once, “And wench, your mouth is a garbage heap; I’ve swept it so much and it’s still not clean!”
Saying this, she stomped away.
One by one, the room emptied.
Ramchandra Ray found some peace!

The middle-aged woman then left the chamber and went to the Mahishi's room.
The Mahishi was there, feeding the servants.
Rammohan was also sitting to one side, eating.
The middle-aged woman approached the Mahishi, observed her, and said, “So, it is Mother Nikasha!”

The moment he heard this, Rammohan started and stared at the woman's face.
Instantly abandoning his meal, he leapt like a tiger, seized her two hands in an iron grip, and roared in a thunderous voice, “I know you, Thakur!”
With that, he pulled the cloth from her head.
It was none other than Ramai Thakur!

Rammohan began to tremble with rage and threw off his shawl.
With both hands, he effortlessly lifted Ramai into the air, declaring, “Today you will die by my hands!” and swung him around in the air once or twice.
The Mahishi ran over, crying, “Rammohan, what are you doing?”

Ramai pleaded in a pitiful voice, “I beg you, father, do not commit the sin of killing a Brahmin!”
A great commotion arose from all sides.
Rammohan then lowered Ramai to the ground and, still trembling, said, “You wretch, could you find no other place to die?”

Ramai said, “The Maharaj has ordered me.”

Rammohan exclaimed, “What did you say, you traitor?
If you say such a thing again, I will grind your face on this stone floor!”
and he seized him by the throat.

Ramai cried out in pain.
Then Rammohan tied the short-statured Ramai up with a shawl, slung him over his shoulder like a sack, and left the inner quarters.

In no time, the news had spread quite far.
It was past the second prahar of the night.
The king’s brother-in-law came that night and informed Pratapaditya that his son-in-law had brought Ramai Bhand into the inner quarters disguised as a woman!
There, he had mocked the women of the court, even the Mahishi.

At this, Pratapaditya’s expression became utterly terrifying.
His whole body was agitated with rage.
He sat up from his bed like a lion with a bristling mane.
He commanded, “Call Lachhman Sardar.”
To Lachhman Sardar he said, “Tonight, I want to see Ramchandra Ray's severed head!”
The man immediately saluted and said, “As you command, Maharaj!”

Instantly, his brother-in-law fell at his feet, pleading, “Maharaj, grant him pardon, think of Vibha for a moment.
Do not do such a thing!”

Pratapaditya repeated in a firm voice, “I want Ramchandra Ray’s head by the end of the night!”

His brother-in-law clung to his feet and said, “Maharaj, they are sleeping in the inner quarters tonight, grant him pardon, Maharaj, grant him pardon!”

Pratapaditya remained silent for a moment and then said, “Lachhman, listen.
Tomorrow morning, when Ramchandra Ray leaves the inner quarters, you will kill him.
That is your order.”

The brother-in-law saw that things had gone much further than he had imagined.
That night, he crept quietly to the door of Vibha’s bedchamber and knocked.

From a distance, the nahabat for the second prahar was playing.
In the silent night, the sound of the nahabat, mingling with the moonlight and the southern breeze, was creating dreams within sleeping souls.
Through the open window of Vibha’s bedchamber, the moonlight fell upon the bed.
Ramchandra Ray was deep in sleep.
Vibha had sat up and was thinking quietly, her hand on her cheek.
As she gazed at the moonlight, a few teardrops fell from her eyes.
Perhaps things had not turned out exactly as she had imagined.
Her heart was weeping.
The day she had awaited for so long had finally arrived.

Ever since lying down on the bed, Ramchandra Ray had not spoken a single word to Vibha.
Pratapaditya had insulted him—so how would he insult Pratapaditya?
Why, by ignoring Vibha.
He wanted to convey, “You are the daughter of Pratapaditya of Jessore; do you really belong beside Ramchandra Ray, the King of Chandradwip?”
Having decided this, he had turned to his side and had not moved since.
All his wounded pride and resentment were directed towards Vibha.
Vibha sat awake, thinking.
She glanced once at the moonlight, then at her husband’s face.
Her chest heaved with intermittent deep sighs—a great pain had struck her heart.

Suddenly, Ramchandra’s sleep broke.
He suddenly saw Vibha sitting silently, crying.
In that first moment upon waking, when the memory of the humiliation had not yet resurfaced, when a sense of well-being had returned after a deep sleep and his anger had faded, the sudden sight of Vibha's tear-stained, sorrowful, innocent face awakened a sudden pity in his heart.
Taking her hand, he said, “Vibha, are you crying?”

Vibha was overcome with emotion.
Vibha could not speak, Vibha could not see through her tears, Vibha lay down.
Then Ramchandra Ray sat up, gently took Vibha's head, and placed it on his lap, wiping away her tears.
Just then, someone knocked on the door.
Ramchandra called out, “Who is it?”

A voice replied from outside, “Open the door at once!”

## Chapter 10

Ramchandra Ray opened the door of the bedchamber and came outside.
His brother-in-law Ramapati said, “Baba, escape right now, do not delay for a moment.”

Hearing these words so suddenly that night, Ramchandra Ray was utterly startled.
His face turned white, and with bated breath, he asked, “Why, why, what has happened?”

“I will not tell you what has happened.
Escape now.”

Vibha, leaving her bed, came and asked, “Mama, what has happened?”

Ramapati said, “There is no need for you to hear it, Ma!”

Vibha’s heart cried out.
She thought of Basanta Ray, and then she thought of Udayaditya.
She cried, “Mama, what has happened!
Tell me!”

Ramapati, giving no answer to her words, said to Ramchandra, “Baba, we are wasting precious time.
Find a way to escape secretly while you can.”

Suddenly, a terrible, ominous fear arose in Vibha’s mind.
Blocking her departing uncle’s path, she said, “Oh, I beg you at your feet, tell me what has happened before you go!”

Ramapati, looking around fearfully, said, “Don’t make a scene, Vibha, be quiet, I am telling you everything!”

When Ramapati had told her everything, piece by piece, Vibha was on the verge of letting out a scream.
Ramapati quickly covered her mouth and said, “Quiet, quiet, don’t bring ruin upon us!”
With bated breath and in a half-choked voice, Vibha sank to the floor right there.

Ramchandra Ray said plaintively, “What am I to do now?
What path of escape is there?
I know nothing!”

Ramapati said, “Tonight, the guards are alert everywhere.
Let me go look around and see if there is any way.”

Saying this, he made to leave.
Vibha grabbed him and said, “Mama, where are you going!
Don’t go, stay here with us.”

Ramapati said, “Vibha, have you gone mad!
My being here will be of no use.
In the meantime, let me go and assess the situation outside.”

Vibha then forced herself to her feet.
Her hands and feet were trembling violently.
She said, “Mama, you stay here a little longer.
I am going to Dada.”
With that, Vibha hurried to Udayaditya’s bedchamber.

The faint moon was about to set.
Darkness was closing in all around.
There was no sound anywhere.
Ramchandra Ray, standing at the door of his bedchamber, saw that on both sides the doors to the rows of rooms in the royal inner quarters were shut; everyone was sleeping without a care.
In the courtyard ahead, the shadows of the surrounding walls had fallen, and on one side, a small patch of moonlight still remained.
Gradually, that too faded away.
Darkness, one step at a time, took possession of the entire world.
Darkness came and settled among the rows of coconut trees in the distant garden.
Darkness drew very close, nestling right beside him!
Ramchandra Ray began to imagine that somewhere in this surrounding darkness, a knife was waiting for him!
To the right or the left, in front or behind?
In one of the scattered corners visible here and there, was someone not sitting silently, face buried, entire body covered with a shawl?
What if someone was inside the room!—Under the bed, or to one side of the wall!
His whole body shuddered, and sweat began to trickle down his forehead.
For a moment, the thought occurred to him: what if Mama does something, what if he has some ulterior motive?
He slowly moved a little away.
A gust of wind came and blew out the lamp in the room.
Ramchandra thought—someone must have put out the lamp—someone must be in the room.
Moving closer to Ramapati, he called out, “Mama.”
Mama said, “What is it, Baba?”
Ramchandra Ray thought to himself, it would be better if Vibha were here, I don’t quite trust Mama.

Vibha rushed to Udayaditya and collapsed in tears; no words would come out of her mouth.
Surma helped her up to a sitting position and asked, “What has happened, Vibha?”
Vibha clung to Surma with both hands, still unable to say a single word.
Udayaditya affectionately placed a hand on Vibha’s head and said, “Why, Vibha, what is it?”
Vibha grabbed her brother’s hands and said, “Brother, come with me, you will hear everything.”

The three of them went together to the door of Vibha’s bedchamber.
There, Ramchandra was sitting in the darkness, and Ramapati was standing.
Udayaditya quickly asked, “Uncle, what has happened?”
Ramapati recounted the entire story.
Udayaditya, widening his large eyes, looked at Surma and declared, “I will go to Father at once.
I will not let him do this, under any circumstances!
Absolutely not!”

Surma said, “Will that do any good?
It would be better to send our grand-uncle to him instead.
Perhaps that might help.”

The Yubaraj said, “Very well.”

Basanta Ray was in a deep sleep.
Waking up and seeing Udayaditya, he thought it must be dawn.
He immediately prepared to sing a song in Raga Lalit—

“The flower in her hair has withered, while flowers bloom in the forest grove;

The light of day has broken, but my heart’s desire remains unfulfilled!”

Udayaditya said, “Grand-uncle, a disaster has occurred.”

Basanta Ray’s song stopped instantly.
He rose in alarm, came to Udayaditya, and asked agitatedly, “What!
What is it, grandson!
What has happened?
What disaster!”

Udayaditya told him everything.
Basanta Ray sank down onto the bed.
Looking at Udayaditya’s face, he shook his head and said, “No, grandson, no.
Can this ever happen?
Is this even possible?”

Udayaditya said, “There is no more time, go to Father at once!”

Basanta Ray got up and started to leave, asking again and again as he went, “Grandson, can this ever happen?
Is this even possible?”

Upon entering Pratapaditya's chamber, he asked, “My dear Pratap, is this even possible?”
Pratapaditya had not yet gone to his bedchamber—he was sitting in his private council room.
For a fleeting moment, he had thought of calling Lachhman Sardar back.
But that resolve vanished from his mind instantly.
Does Pratapaditya ever give an order twice?
To take back an order with the same mouth that gave it?
It was not his way to play games with his commands.
But Vibha?
Vibha would be a widow.
If Ramchandra Ray had willingly thrown himself into a fire, Vibha would have become a widow then too—Ramchandra Ray has willingly thrown himself into the fire of Pratapaditya Ray's wrath, and as its inevitable consequence, Vibha will become a widow!
What hand did Pratapaditya have in this?
But even these thoughts had barely crossed his mind.
Whenever the whole incident resurfaced vividly in his thoughts, he would become utterly restless, wondering when the night would end.
It was at this exact moment that the old Basanta Ray entered the room in a hurry and, grasping Pratapaditya's hands anxiously, said, “My dear Pratap, is this even possible?”

Pratapaditya flared up at once, saying, “Why isn't it possible?”

Basanta Ray said, “He is just a boy, imprudent, is he a worthy subject for your wrath?”

Pratapaditya exclaimed, “Just a boy!
Has he not reached the age to understand that if you put your hand in the fire, it will burn!
Just a boy!
He brought some wretched, idiotic, foolish Brahmin, who earns his living by grinning at fools, dressed him as a woman to mock my queen;—the mind that could contrive so much intelligence, could not muster the sense to know what its consequence might be!
The tragedy is, by the time that sense dawns in his head, his head will no longer be on his body.”
The more he spoke, the more his body trembled, his resolve hardened, and his impatience grew.

Basanta Ray shook his head and said, “Alas, he is just a boy!
He understands nothing!”

It became unbearable for Pratapaditya.
He said, “Look, Uncle, if you had any sense of what brings honor or dishonor to the Ray Bamsa of Jessore, could you then walk around with the Mughal emperor’s turban of honor wrapped on that white hair!
Because you walk with your head held high in pride of the emperor’s favor, Pratapaditya’s head is bowed low.
You wear the dust from the Yavana’s feet as a mark on your forehead.
I had a desire to see that insignificant, Yavana-dust-covered head of yours roll in the dust, but fate’s mockery prevented it.
I am telling you this plainly.
It is because you are you that you don't understand how great an insult the Ray Bamsa has suffered today, and it is because you are you that you have come today to beg for mercy for the one who insulted the Ray Bamsa.”

Basanta Ray then said slowly, “Pratap, I understand;—when you raise your knife once, it seeks to fall upon someone.
Because I moved away from its aim, another has become its target.
Very well, Pratap, if there is no mercy in your heart, if your hungry wrath must devour someone, then let it be me!
Here is your uncle’s head; (saying so, Basanta Ray bowed his head) if you find satisfaction in taking it, then take it.
Bring the knife.
This head has no hair, this face has no youthful beauty; Yama has sent the invitation, and the attire for that assembly is also ready.
(A very faint smile appeared on Basanta Ray's face.)
But think for a moment, Pratap, Vibha is our darling girl, when tears fall from her two eyes then—” As he spoke, Basanta Ray broke down completely in an uncontrollable outburst of tears.
“Finish me, Pratap!
There is no joy for me in living.
Finish me before I have to see the tears in her eyes.”

Pratapaditya had been silent all this while.
When Basanta Ray finished speaking, he slowly stood up and walked away.
He understood that the matter had been revealed.
Going downstairs, he called for the guards and ordered that the canal adjoining the royal palace be blocked immediately with large logs of Sal wood.
Ramchandra Ray’s boat was in that canal.
He gave the guards a special warning that no one should be allowed to leave the inner quarters tonight.

## Chapter 11

When Basanta Ray returned to the inner quarters, Vibha burst into tears upon seeing him.
Basanta Ray could no longer hold back his own tears.
He grasped Udayaditya’s hand and said, “Dada, you must find a way to fix this.”
Ramchandra Ray became completely frantic.
At that, Udayaditya took his sword in hand.
“Come,” he said, “follow me.”

Everyone followed along.
Udayaditya said, “Vibha, you stay here.
Don’t come.”
Vibha did not listen.
Ramchandra Ray also said, “No, let Vibha come with us.”

In that silent night, they all began to walk on tiptoe.
It felt as if a great horror was stretching out its invisible hands from all sides.
Ramchandra Ray kept glancing in front, behind, and to his sides.
Now and then, suspicion towards his uncle began to arise.
Reaching the door that led from the inner quarters to the outside, Udayaditya saw that it was locked.
In a voice trembling with fear, Vibha said, “Dada, perhaps they haven’t locked the door leading downstairs.
Let’s go there!”

They all headed in that direction.
They began to descend a long, dark staircase.
It seemed to Ramchandra Ray that no one who went down these stairs ever came back up—that this must be the pit of the serpent Vasuki, the very stairs leading down to the underworld.
When the stairs ended, they went to the door and found it locked.
Again, they all slowly climbed back up.
Every single path leading out of the inner quarters was locked.
They wandered together from door to door, returning to check each one two or three times.
All were locked.

When Vibha saw there was no way out, she wiped away her tears.
Taking her husband's hand, she led him to their bedchamber.
She stood firmly by the door and said in an unwavering voice, “Let’s see who can take you out of this room!
Wherever you go, I will go before you.
Let’s see who dares to stop me!”

Udayaditya stood near the door and declared, “No one will enter this room without killing me first.”

Surma said nothing, but went and stood by her husband’s side.
Old Basanta Ray came and stood before them all.
The uncle slowly walked away.
But Ramchandra Ray did not like this arrangement at all.
He was thinking, “From what I’ve seen, what is Pratapaditya not capable of?
I have no hope that Vibha and Udayaditya, by standing in the middle, can achieve anything.
If only I could get out of this house somehow, I would be saved.”

After a while, Surma said to Udayaditya in a low voice, “I don’t think any good will come of us standing here; rather, the opposite.
The more resistance Father meets, the more resolute his purpose will become.
Tell me a way to escape from the palace by any means tonight!”

Udayaditya looked thoughtfully at Surma’s face for a moment and said, “Then I will go and see if I can use force!”

Surma nodded her head firmly in assent.
“Go,” she said.

Udayaditya threw off his shawl and left.
Surma followed him for a short distance.
Reaching a secluded spot, she threw her arms around Udayaditya’s chest in an embrace.
Udayaditya bent his head and gave her a long kiss; and in an instant, he was gone.
Then Surma returned to her bedchamber.
Tears streamed from her eyes.
With folded hands, she pleaded, “Oh, Mother—if I am a virtuous and devoted wife, then save my husband from his father’s hands this time.
I sent him into this danger today relying only on you, Ma!
If you destroy me, then no one on earth will ever believe in you again.”
As she spoke, she broke down crying.
In that darkness, Surma called out “Ma,” “Ma” in her mind so many times, but it felt as if the Mother did not hear her words.
The flower offering she made to Her feet in her mind seemed to be rejected, to fall away.
Surma cried, “Why, Ma?
What have I done?”
She heard no answer.
In the darkness all around, she saw the form of the apocalypse dancing!
Surma saw nothing but emptiness in every direction.
She could no longer sit alone in that room.
She went out and came to Vibha's room.

Basanta Ray said in a distressed voice, “Dada still has not returned.
What will happen?”

Surma leaned against the wall and replied, “Whatever Vidhata wills!”

Ramchandra Ray, meanwhile, was mentally plotting the utter ruin of his old retainer, Rammohan!
For it was because of him that this whole disaster had occurred.
He was devising every possible punishment for him.
Every so often, the thought would dawn on him that he might not get the chance to inflict any punishment at all.

Udayaditya, sword in hand, crossed the inner quarters, went to the locked door, and kicked it forcefully—he said, “Who’s there?”

From outside, the reply came, “Your command, it is I, Sitaram!”

The Yubaraj said in a firm voice—“Open the door quickly.”

He opened the door immediately.
As Udayaditya was about to leave, he said with folded hands,—“Yubaraj, forgive me—there are orders for no one to leave the inner quarters tonight.”

The Yubaraj said—“Sitaram, will you then also take up arms against me?
Very well, then come.”
Saying this, he drew his sword.

Sitaram said with folded hands, “No, Yubaraj, I cannot take up arms against you—you have saved my life twice.”
Saying this, he took the dust from Udayaditya's feet and touched it to his head.

The Yubaraj said, “Then what do you want to do?
Do it quickly—there is no more time.”

Sitaram said—“Do not destroy the life you have saved twice.
Disarm me.
Here, take my weapon.
Bind me from head to foot.
Otherwise, there will be no saving me from the Maharaj tomorrow.”

The Yubaraj took his weapon and tied him up with his own cloth.
He remained lying there, and the prince left.
A little further on, there was a very high wall.
That wall had only one door, and that door was also locked.
Crossing that door meant getting completely outside the inner quarters.
Without striking the door, the Yubaraj leaped straight onto the wall.
He saw a guard leaning against the wall, sleeping in perfect comfort.
Very carefully, he climbed down.
He fell upon the sleeping guard with the speed of lightning.
He snatched his weapon and threw it far away, and then tied up the bewildered and overwhelmed guard from head to foot.
The guard had a key on him; snatching the key, he opened the door.
The guard then regained his senses and said in an astonished voice—“Yubaraj, what are you doing?”

The Yubaraj said, “Opening the door to the inner quarters.”

The guard said,—“What answer will I give to the Maharaj tomorrow?”

Udayaditya said, “Tell him the Yubaraj overpowered us by force and opened the door to the inner quarters.
Then you will be spared.”

Udayaditya, having left the inner quarters, arrived at the room where the son-in-law's men were staying.
In that room, only Rammohan and Ramai Bhand were sleeping; all the others had eaten and gone to the boat.
The Yubaraj gently touched Rammohan.
He jumped up with a start.
Astonished, he said—“What is this, Yubaraj?”
The Yubaraj said, “Come outside.”
Rammohan came outside.
The Yubaraj told Rammohan everything.

Then Rammohan tied his shawl around his head, brandished his staff, and, swelling with anger, said, “We'll see how great a man this Lachhman Sardar is.
Yubaraj, just bring our Maharaj to me once.
I alone can drive off a hundred men with this staff!”

The Yubaraj said, “I believe that, but in the royal palace of Jessore, there are many more than a hundred men!
You will not be able to do anything by force.
We must find another way.”

Rammohan said, “Very well, bring the Maharaj to me once.
If he stands by my side, I can think of a plan with a peaceful mind.”
Then Udayaditya went into the inner quarters and called for Ramchandra.
He and everyone with him came.

Upon seeing Rammohan, Ramchandra was overcome with anger and said— “I dismiss you this instant—get out of my sight!
You are an old retainer, what more punishment can I give you—if I survive this ordeal, I will never see your face again.”
As he spoke, Ramchandra's voice choked.
He truly loved Rammohan; Rammohan had raised him since childhood.

Rammohan said with folded hands, “Who are you to dismiss me, Maharaj?
Bhagavan has given me this service.
The day Yama summons me, that is the day Bhagavan will release me from this service.
Whether you keep me or not, I am your servant.”
Saying this, he stood protectively in front of Ramchandra.

Udayaditya said, “Rammohan, what is the plan?”

Rammohan replied, “With the blessing of your honored feet, this staff is the plan.
And my trust is in the feet of Ma-Kali.”

Udayaditya shook his head and said, “That plan is of no use.
Alright, Rammohan, on which side is your boat?”

Rammohan said, “In the canal on the south side of the palace.”

Udayaditya said, “Let’s go up to the roof.”

An idea suddenly occurred to Rammohan—he said, “Yes, that’s right, let’s go there.”

Everyone went up to the palace roof.
The canal was about seventy cubits below the roof.
In that canal, Ramchandra's sixty-four-oared boat was floating.
Rammohan said that he would tie Ramchandra Ray to his back and jump down from there.

Basanta Ray, in a flurry, quickly grabbed Rammohan and exclaimed, “No, no, no, how can that be?
Rammohan, don’t you go trying such an impossible thing.”

Vibha, startled, cried out in terror, “No, Mohan, what are you saying!”

Ramchandra said, “No, Rammohan, that will not do.”

Then Udayaditya went to the inner quarters and brought back several very thick, large sheets he had collected.
Rammohan twisted and tied them together to prepare something like a huge rope.
He tied the rope to a small pillar on the roof on the side where the boat was.
The rope ended a little above the boat.
Rammohan said to Ramchandra Ray, “Maharaj, you will hold onto my back, and I will climb down the rope.”
Ramchandra reluctantly agreed.
Then Rammohan bowed to everyone one by one and took the dust from everyone's feet, saying, “Victory to Ma-Kali!”
He lifted Ramchandra onto his back, and Ramchandra, closing his eyes, clung to his back with all his might.
Looking at Vibha, Rammohan said, “Ma, then I am leaving.
While your son is here, do not have any fear!”

Rammohan gripped the rope.
Vibha leaned against a pillar and stood with all her might.
The elderly Basanta Ray, standing on trembling feet, closed his eyes and began to chant, “Durga!
Durga!”
Rammohan climbed down the rope until he reached its very end.
Then, letting go with his hands, he gripped the rope with his teeth, released Ramchandra from his back, and lowered him with both hands very carefully into the boat, before jumping down himself.
As soon as Ramchandra was in the boat, he fainted.
And as Ramchandra was lowered into the boat, Vibha let out a deep, long sigh and fell into a faint.
Basanta Ray opened his eyes and asked, “My boy, what happened?”
Udayaditya affectionately took the fainted Vibha in his arms and went into the inner quarters.
Surma held Udayaditya’s hand and said, “What will happen to you now?”
Udayaditya replied, “I do not worry for myself.”

Meanwhile, the boat went a short distance before it was stopped.
The canal was blocked with large sal wood logs!
At that moment, the guards suddenly saw from afar that the boat was escaping.
They started throwing stones, but not a single one reached.
The guards had swords, but no guns.
One went to fetch a gun.
After a frantic search, a gun was found, but a flintlock could not be—while they were shouting, “Hey, where’s the gunpowder—where are the bullets?”
Rammohan and his followers pulled the boat up and over the logs.
The guards went to call for a boat to give chase.
The man entrusted with fetching the boat stopped on the way at Harimudi’s shop to smoke a pipeful of tobacco and went to wake Ramashankar from his bed to press him for the prompt payment of a debt.
The boat finally arrived with much shouting and clamor, long after it was needed.
Seeing the delay, everyone began to berate the boat-caller at length.
He said, “I am not a horse, after all!”
By the time each of them had finished scolding him, it dawned on them that there was no longer any chance of catching the boat.
The scolding took three times longer than the delay in bringing the boat.

When Ramchandra’s boat reached the Bhairav river, Fernandez fired a cannon.
At dawn, sleep had finally overcome Pratapaditya.
He was startled awake by the sound of that cannon.
He called out, “Guard!”
No one came.
The guards at his door had fled that very night.
Pratapaditya called out in a louder voice, “Guard!”

## Chapter 12

Waking from his sleep, Pratapaditya shouted, “Guard!”
When no guard came, he immediately left his bed and rushed out of the room like a flash of lightning.
He called, “Minister!”
A servant ran and promptly summoned the minister to the inner quarters.

“Minister, where have the guards gone?”

The minister replied, “The guards at the outer gate have fled.”
The minister saw that danger was looming over his head.
For this reason, he gave a clear, direct, and quick reply to Pratapaditya’s question.
The more one equivocated and delayed in answering him, the more he would fly into a rage.

Pratapaditya said, “And the guards of the inner quarters?”

The minister replied, “On my way here, I saw them lying tied hand and foot.”
The minister knew nothing of the night’s events!
He could not guess what had happened, yet he understood that some terrible incident had occurred.
At such a time, it was impossible to ask the Maharaj any questions.

Pratapaditya quickly blurted out, “Where is Ramchandra Ray?
Where is Udayaditya?
Where is Basanta Ray?”

The minister said slowly, “I believe they are in the inner quarters!”

Annoyed, Pratapaditya said, “I could have believed that myself!
Then why did I ask you!
What one believes is not always true!”

Saying nothing, the minister slowly went out.
He learned all about the night's events from Ramapati.
When he heard that Ramchandra Ray had fled, he became particularly worried.
Going outside, the minister saw the short Ramai Bhand sitting hunched over.
Seeing the minister, Ramai Bhand said, “Well, if it isn’t Minister Jambuban!” and bared his teeth.
The courtiers of Ramchandra called that tooth-baring grin humor, not a terrifying sight!
The minister heard his warm greeting but said nothing, not even glancing at him.
He told a servant, “Bring him here!”
The minister thought, ‘Let me place this worthless fellow before Pratapaditya’s wrath right now.
Pratapaditya’s thunderbolt is bound to fall on someone—let it fall on this banana plant, and let the larger trees be spared!’

Upon seeing Ramai, Pratapaditya immediately flew into a rage—especially when Ramai, in an attempt to please him, bared his teeth, made gestures, and began to tell a joke.
Pratapaditya could not bear it any longer.
He immediately rose from his seat, waved his hands, and cried out in utter disgust, “Get rid of him, get rid of him right now!
Who told you to bring that thing before me?”
Had disgust not risen with Pratapaditya’s anger, Ramai Bhand would not have escaped this time!
For even to strike a despicable person, one must touch them.
Ramai was thrown out at once.

The minister said, “Maharaj, the royal son-in-law—”

Pratapaditya impatiently shook his head and said, “Ramchandra Ray—”

The minister said, “Yes, he left the royal palace last night.”

Pratapaditya stood up and said, “Left!
Where did the guards go?”

The minister repeated, “The guards at the outer gate have fled.”

Pratapaditya clenched his fist and said, “Fled?
Where will they flee?
They must be found wherever they are!
Bring the guards of the inner quarters here at once!”
The minister went out.

It was still dark when Ramchandra Ray boarded the boat.
Udayaditya, Basanta Ray, Surma, and Vibha did not return to their beds that night.
Vibha lay listlessly, not speaking a word, not shedding a tear, while Surma sat beside her, stroking her head.
Udayaditya and Basanta Ray sat in silence.
In the dark room, they could see each other’s faces only dimly.
It was as if an unseen presence—call it darkness, call it dread, call it destiny—was sitting in the room, and the sound of its breathing could be heard.
The ever-cheerful Basanta Ray was utterly distraught by the gloom around him.
He continuously stroked his bald head, looked around, and thought—what has happened!
Something felt amiss; he could not quite grasp the situation.
The entire incident felt like a complex nightmare.
Every now and then, Basanta Ray would grab Udayaditya's hand and say in a plaintive voice, “Dada!”

Udayaditya would reply, “Yes, Grand-uncle?”

After that, Basanta Ray had no more words.
In that single address, “Dada,” a thousand unspoken questions from a distraught and lost heart writhed to be expressed.
He had no specific question; the meaning of all his words was simply—what is this?
The surrounding darkness spoke to him in some chaotic language that he could not understand at all.
At such times, hearing Udayaditya's voice would calm his mind a little.
Again and again, he clutched Udayaditya's hand and asked plaintively, “Dada, did all this happen because of me?”
The thought kept returning to him that all this had occurred because they had failed to kill him.

Udayaditya was in no mood to speak much then.
He said in a gentle voice, “No, Grand-uncle!”

The room fell silent for a long time.
After a while, Basanta Ray called out again, “Vibha, my dear sister, why are you not speaking?”
Saying this, Basanta Ray went and sat beside Vibha.

A few moments later, Basanta Ray called out again, “Surma, oh Surma!”

Surma looked up but said nothing more.
The old man sat there, stroking his head.
He waited for some unforeseen disaster.
Surma sat calmly, stroking Vibha's forehead, but what was happening in Surma's own heart, only the One who sees all could know.
In that darkness, Surma glanced once at Udayaditya's face.
He was leaning his head against the wall, lost in thought.
Tears streamed from Surma's eyes.
She wiped them away gently, lest Vibha find out.

When light began to fill the surroundings, Basanta Ray breathed a sigh of relief.
The sense of nameless dread left his mind.
He then calmly reviewed the entire sequence of events.
He got up and left Vibha's room.
He went to Sitaram, who was tied hand and foot at the gate of the inner quarters.
He said to him, “Look, Sitaram, when Pratap asks who tied you up, you tell him my name.
Pratap knows that Basanta Ray was once a strong man; he will believe your words.”

Sitaram had been pondering what to tell Pratapaditya.
His mind was completely unwilling to mention Udayaditya's name in this matter.
He had for a moment decided to frame a crooked-legged, three-eyed, palm-tree-sized ghost, but upon finding Basanta Ray, he acquitted the innocent spirit.
He immediately agreed to Basanta Ray's words.

Then he went to the second guard and said, “Bhagavat, when Pratap asks, tell him Basanta Ray tied you up.”
Suddenly, Bhagavat's sense of dharma became extremely strong; a profound aversion to falsehood arose in him.
The main reason for this was that he had become very angry with Udayaditya.

Bhagavat said, “Do not command me to say such a thing, it would be a sin for me.”

Basanta Ray placed a hand on his shoulder and said, “Bhagavat, listen to me; there is no sin in this.
If there were any sin in telling a lie to save a good man’s life, why would I make such a request of you?”
Basanta Ray, with his hand on his shoulder and back, tried repeatedly to explain that there was no sin in this.
But when a person's sense of dharma suddenly becomes especially strong, no logic works on him.
He said, “No, Maharaj, how can I tell a lie to my master!”

Basanta Ray became terribly agitated.
He said in a frantic voice, “Bhagavat, listen to me, let me explain, there is no sin in this lie.
Look, my good man, I will make you very happy later, just do as I say.
Here, take what I have with me, I give you this.”

Bhagavat immediately extended his hand, and in a moment, the money found refuge in his waistband.
Basanta Ray, somewhat relieved, turned back.

The two guards were summoned before Pratapaditya.
The minister brought them along with him.
Pratapaditya, having suppressed his overflowing rage, was now sitting in a calm, grave manner.
Pronouncing each word slowly and clearly, he said, “How was the door to the inner quarters opened last night?”

Sitaram’s heart trembled.
With folded hands, he said, “Mercy, Maharaj, I am not at fault.”

The Maharaj furrowed his brow and said, “Who is asking you that?”

Sitaram quickly said, “No, your command, I mean, Maharaj; the Yubaraj—the Yubaraj forcefully tied me up and came out of the inner quarters.”
The Yubaraj’s name had suddenly slipped out of his mouth.
He had thought more than anything about not mentioning that name under any circumstances, and for this reason, in the confusion, that very name was the first to come to his lips.
Once it was out, there was no saving the situation.

Just then, Basanta Ray heard that the guards had been summoned.
He rushed to Pratapaditya’s chamber.
At that moment, Sitaram was saying, “I forbade the Yubaraj, but he did not listen.”

Basanta Ray quickly cried out, “Hey, hey Sitaram, what are you saying?
Do not commit a sin, Sitaram, Bhagavan will be pleased with you.
Udayaditya is not at fault in this.”

Sitaram quickly blurted out, “No, your command, the Yubaraj is not at fault.”

Pratapaditya said in a firm voice, “Then is it your fault?”

Sitaram said, “No, your command.”

“Then whose fault is it?”

“Your command, the Yubaraj—”

When Bhagavat was questioned, he told the whole story correctly, only hiding the fact that he had fallen asleep.
Old Basanta Ray, considering everything, saw no way out.
He closed his eyes and mentally chanted, “Durga, Durga.”
The two guards were immediately dismissed from their posts.
Their crime was this: if they could be forcefully tied up, then why had they come to be guards in the first place?
For this crime, they were sentenced to be flogged.

Then Pratapaditya, looking at Basanta Ray’s face, said in a thunderously grave voice, “There is no forgiveness for this crime of Udayaditya’s.”
He said it in such a way as if Udayaditya’s crime was Basanta Ray’s own.
As if he were reprimanding Udayaditya while keeping him right in front.
Basanta Ray’s crime was that he loved Udayaditya more than his own life.

Basanta Ray quickly cried out, “Baba Pratap, Uday has no fault in this.”

Pratapaditya, becoming fiery, said, “No fault?
Precisely because you say he has no fault, I will punish him especially!
Why have you come to mediate in this?”

Precisely because Basanta Ray had so strongly taken Udayaditya’s side, Pratapaditya’s mind turned especially against Udayaditya.
Basanta Ray saw that Udayaditya might be punished simply to punish him.
He sat silently and began to think.

After a while, having calmed down, Pratapaditya said, “If I thought Udayaditya had even a little of his own mental strength, that he had an opinion, an intention, that whatever he does, he does of his own accord; if I didn't know that anyone who wishes can blow that fool around like a feather, can make him spin and fall with a glance, then there would have been no saving him today.
Wherever I have seen that feather floating, I have looked down to see who is blowing it!
That is why I have no desire to punish Udayaditya.
He is unworthy even of punishment.
But listen, Uncle Thakur, if you come to Jessore a second time and meet with Udayaditya, it will be difficult to save his life.”

Basanta Ray remained seated silently for a long time; then, slowly getting up, he said, “Very well, Pratap, then I shall leave this evening.”
Without saying another word, Basanta Ray left the room.
Upon going outside, he heaved a deep sigh.

Pratapaditya had decided that whoever loved Udayaditya, whoever Udayaditya was subservient to, must be separated from him.
He told the minister, “The daughter-in-law will no longer be allowed to stay in the royal palace.
On some pretext, she must be sent to her father’s house.”
Pratapaditya had no such apprehension regarding Vibha; after all, she was a daughter of the house!

## Chapter 13

Coming to Udayaditya’s room, Basanta Ray said, “Grandson, I will not see you anymore.”
With these words, the old man embraced Udayaditya with both arms.
Udayaditya took Basanta Ray’s hand and said, “Why, Grand-uncle?”
Basanta Ray explained everything.
Crying, he said, “My boy, you suffer so much only because I love you.
But, if you can be happy, I will somehow get through my days.”
Shaking his head, Udayaditya said, “No, that will never happen.
We will see each other.
No one can prevent it.
If you leave, Grand-uncle, I will not survive.”
Basanta Ray said in distress, “Pratap did not kill me; he snatched you away from me.
Grandson, when I leave, do not look back at me, just think that Basanta Ray has died!”
Udayaditya went to Surma in the bedchamber.
Basanta Ray went to Vibha, held her chin, and said, “My dear Vibha, get up for a moment!
Run your hand over this old man’s head just once.”
Vibha sat up, took her grand-uncle’s head, and began to pluck out his grey hairs.
Udayaditya told Surma everything and said, “Surma, it is as if a conspiracy is afoot to snatch away whatever little I have left in this world.”
Holding Surma’s hand, he said, “Surma, what if someone snatches you away from me?”
Surma embraced Udayaditya firmly and said in a resolute voice, “Only Yama can do that, and no one else.”
A similar fear had been growing in Surma's mind for some time.
It was as if she could see a cruel hand advancing to push her Udayaditya away from her.
In her mind, she held Udayaditya in a desperate embrace and said to herself, “I will not let go, no one can make me let go.”
Surma said again, “I have been resolved for a long time that no one can take me from you.”
Surma repeated those words again and again.
She wanted to gather strength within her mind, the kind of strength with which she could wrap Udayaditya in her arms so tightly that no earthly power could separate them.
By repeating those words, she was binding her mind with the force of a thunderbolt.

Udayaditya, looking at Surma's face, sighed and said, “Surma, I will never see Grand-uncle again!”

Surma sighed.

Udayaditya said, “I don't worry about my own suffering, Surma—but it will hurt Grand-uncle's heart so much.
Let's see what more Vidhat will do.
What more does He wish!”

Udayaditya told many stories of Basanta Ray.

He began to remember everything Basanta Ray had said and done, here and there.
The many small acts and small words from Basanta Ray's compassionate heart, which he had stored like little gems in the treasury of his memory, he now brought them out one by one before Surma.

Surma said, “Ah, is there anyone else like Grand-uncle?”

Surma and Udayaditya went to Vibha's room.

At that moment, Vibha was plucking her Grand-uncle's grey hairs, and he was sitting and singing a song:—

“O, it's time to go, there's no more delay,

How long will you stay behind?
All your companions have gone.

Come, finish the games of this world, for darkness has descended,

(O) looking back again and again, at whom do you gaze, brother?

New people have come to the world's stage to play new games,

Come, move away from here, or they will throw stones at you.

Set down the burden of your soul, go straight to another land,

(There) you will build a new home and play new games in that place.”

Seeing Udayaditya, Basanta Ray laughed and said, “Look, my boy, Vibha doesn’t want to let me go.
I don't know what need she has of me!
The milk that once was has turned to buttermilk in old age, so why does Vibha want to quench her thirst for milk with buttermilk?
She cries hearing I will leave!
Have you ever heard of such a thing?
My boy, I cannot bear to see Vibha’s tears.”
Saying this, he began to sing,

“My time to leave has come,

Why do you hold me back?

With the shackles of your tears,

Don’t bind me in the threads of affection anymore.

My life’s leave is over;

Avert your two eyes,

Don’t call my name anymore, my dear,

I must leave in haste!”

“Look there, look at Vibha’s behavior!
See here, Vibha, if you cry like that then—” As he spoke, Basanta Ray’s words failed him.
Trying to scold Vibha, he could no longer control himself.
He quickly wiped his tears and said with a laugh, “Dada, look, my dear Surma is crying!
Do something about it right now; otherwise, I will truly stay behind and usurp your place.
I will have her pluck my grey hairs with those two hands, I will whisper in her ear from between these broken rows of teeth, and if some other mishap occurs from getting so close to her ear, I will not be the one responsible!”

Basanta Ray saw that no one said a word.
Distressed, he picked up his sitar and began to play it furiously with a great clatter.
But seeing Vibha's tears, his sitar playing was greatly hindered.
His eyes kept blurring with tears, and at times he felt an urge to unleash a torrent of scolding words upon Vibha and everyone present, but the words would not come.
His throat became choked, and he had to stop playing and put the sitar down.
At last, the time for departure arrived.

Embracing Udayaditya for a long time, these were his last words: “I am leaving this sitar behind, Dada, I will not play it anymore.
Surma, my dear, be happy; Vibha—” His words remained unfinished.
Wiping away his tears, he climbed into the palanquin.

## Chapter 14

Mangala's cottage was on the outskirts of Jessore.
She was sitting there, counting her prayer beads.
Just then, a palace maidservant named Matangini arrived, carrying a basket of vegetables.

Matangini said, “I came to the market today and thought, I haven't seen sister Mangala in a long time, so I'll drop by for a visit.
I have a lot of work today, sister, so I can't stay long.”
With that, she set down her basket and settled in comfortably.
“Well, sister, you know everything.
That man of mine used to love me very much—and still does—but I've found out his heart has gone after someone else.
Can't you do something so that hag dies within three nights?”

Mangala had a remedy for every kind of misfortune, from a lost cow to a lost husband.
Besides that, she knew such methods of enchantment that high-ranking palace servants came groveling to her cottage by the score.
The hag whose death within three nights would be Matangini's salvation was none other than Mangala herself!

Mangala laughed to herself and thought, “That hag is in no hurry to die; she will only die after increasing the work of Yama.”
Laughing, she said aloud, “Is there any man so tasteless as to forsake a beauty like you for someone else?
Don't you worry, my dear.
You will win his heart back.
The remedy is in your own eyes—try applying it a little more liberally.
And if that doesn't work, then feed him this root with his paan.”
Saying so, she brought out a dried root.

Mangala asked Matangini, “So, what's the news from the palace?”

Matangini waved her hand dismissively and said, “What business do we have with all that, sister?”

Mangala said, “True.
True.”

Matangini hadn't expected Mangala to agree with her so suddenly and so completely.
She was a bit flustered and said, “Well, there's no harm in telling you; but I really don't have much time today.
I'll tell you everything another day.”
And she remained seated.

Mangala said, “Very well, I'll hear it another day.”

Matangini grew impatient.
“Well then, I must be going, sister.
I'll get an earful for being late.
Look, sister, the other day the King's son-in-law came to our palace, and the very night he arrived, he left without telling anyone.”

Mangala said, “Is that so?
Really?
But why?
This is why I say no one can give me the inside news except for Matangini.”

Beaming, Matangini said, “Do you know the real reason?
That Bou-thakurani of ours can't stand to see anyone happy.
She knows some spell—she has her husband tamed like a sheep.
She... no, sister, never mind.
Someone might overhear and say that Matangini goes around spreading palace gossip.”

Mangala couldn't contain her curiosity any longer.
Although she knew that if she stayed quiet for a little while longer, Matangini would tell her everything on her own, she couldn't bear the delay.
She said, “There's no one here, my dear.
And what's the harm in talking among ourselves?
So, what did your Bou-thakurani do?”

“She told the son-in-law all sorts of things against our Didithakurani, and that's why he abandoned her and left in the middle of the night.
Didithakurani is crying her eyes out and making a terrible scene.
The Maharaja is furious; he wants to send Bou-thakurani back to her father's house in Shripur.
Look at you, sister, you laugh at everything!
What's so funny about this?
You can't even contain your laughter.”

Every single maidservant in the palace was correctly informed of the true reason for Ramchandra Ray's flight, but no two accounts were in agreement.

Mangala said, “Tell your Ma-thakurani there's no need to send Bou-thakurani to her father's house so soon.
Mangala can provide a medicine that will make the Yubaraj's heart turn away from her completely.”
And she let out a cackling laugh.
Matangini said, “That sounds good!”

Mangala asked, “Does the Yubaraj love your Bou-thakurani very much?”

“What a question!
He can't bear to be away from her for a moment!
She has him so tamed, he comes running at her slightest call.”

“Alright, I'll give you the medicine.
Does the Yubaraj stay with her during the day as well?”

“Yes.”

Mangala said, “Oh my, what will become of this!
So, have you seen what she says to the Yubaraj, what she does?”

“No, sister, I haven't seen that.”

“Can you take me into the palace sometime?
I could see for myself then!”

Matangini said, “Why, sister?
Why are you so concerned?”

Mangala said, “That's not it.
If I see them just once, I'll understand what spell she has used to enchant him, and whether my spell will work!”

Matangini said, “Alright then, I'll be off for today!”
And taking her basket, she left.

After Matangini left, Mangala seemed to swell up.
Gritting her teeth, her eyes wide, she began to mutter furiously to herself.

## Chapter 15

Basanta Ray departed.
Evening was approaching.
Vibha went to the palace roof.
From the roof, she watched the palanquin leave.
Basanta Ray stuck his head out from within the palanquin and turned to look back one last time.
Through the evening's darkness and his tears, he could dimly see the long, harsh, unchanging, unwavering, stone-hearted walls of the palace.
The palanquin left, but Vibha remained standing there.
She kept gazing down the road.
The stars appeared, the lamps were lit, and the road emptied of people.
Vibha stood and stared silently.
Searching for her all over, Surma finally found her on the roof.
Putting an arm around Vibha's neck, she asked in an affectionate tone, “What are you looking at, Vibha?”

Vibha sighed and said, “Who knows, sister!”

Vibha saw only emptiness in everything; there was no happiness in her heart.
She couldn't find a reason for why she went inside, why she came out, why she lay down, why she got up, why she wandered from room to room in the middle of the day.
It was as if her home had left the palace, as if she had no room in the palace.
The cherished home that had been built for her within the palace from her early childhood, woven with various games, joys and sorrows, laughter and tears—who had demolished that home in a single day!
This was not her home anymore!
She was now homeless within her own house.
She had her grand-uncle, he was gone; her—when would people come from Chandradwip to fetch Vibha?
Perhaps Rammohan Mal was already on his way; who knows where they were by now!
Vibha still had some happiness left.
She had such a brother, she had her beloved Surma, but even concerning them, a disaster seemed to be lurking behind like a shadow.
Can a house where a dark, dense, secret mystery invisibly smolders through its very foundations still be considered a home?

Udayaditya heard of Sitaram's misfortune after being dismissed from his job.
Not only did he not have a single paisa to his name, but he had also acquired several hangers-on.
This was because when he used to receive a handsome salary from the palace, his paternal uncle, overcome by a sudden excess of affection, had quit all his work and become distressed by the separation from his dear one; having made arrangements for a reunion, he had declared, overcome with joy, that the mere sight of Sitaram made his hunger and thirst vanish.
There was much proof regarding the vanishing of his hunger and thirst, but there was no proof as to whether it happened just by looking at Sitaram.
A distant widowed sister of Sitaram was about to send her son off to work when it suddenly dawned on her that appointing her child to a lowly job would be an insult to his uncle.
Understanding this, she could not bring herself to do such a thing, in order to protect her brother's honor.
Thus, by protecting his honor, she put Sitaram in her debt and, in exchange, arranged for her own sustenance.
On top of this, Sitaram had his widowed mother and an unmarried young daughter.
Furthermore, Sitaram himself was a man of fine tastes; he could not do without his amusements and pleasures.
Sitaram's circumstances had changed, yet none of the accompanying changes had followed.
His uncle's hunger and thirst remained exactly the same; as his nephew grew older, the expanse of his stomach and his regard for his uncle's honor and dishonor also grew.
Besides Sitaram’s money pouch, no one else's stomach showed any signs of shrinking.
Along with his other hangers-on, Sitaram’s expensive tastes also remained; they were growing on credit, and just as the interest swelled, so did they.

Upon hearing of Sitaram’s poverty, Udayaditya fixed a monthly stipend for him and for Bhagavat.
Receiving the money, Sitaram felt extremely ashamed.
Ever since mentioning Udayaditya's name to the Maharaja, he had felt deeply guilty before both himself and Udayaditya.
He burst into tears upon receiving the money from Udayaditya.
One day, upon meeting the Yubaraj, he clasped his feet and begged for forgiveness, addressing him as Bhagavan, Jagadishwar, and the Merciful One.

Bhagavat was a very cool-headed fellow.
He played chess, smoked tobacco, and distributed plots of land in heaven and hell among his neighbors.
When he received Udayaditya's money, he twisted his face and conveyed through various expressions that for the ruination the Yubaraj had caused him, how could this money be any compensation!
He made no objection to taking the money.

The news that the Yubaraj was giving a monthly stipend to the two dismissed guards reached Pratapaditya's ears.
Before, it would not have.
Before, he had neglected Udayaditya so much that not all news concerning him reached his ears.
The Maharaj knew that Udayaditya mixed with the common people and often opposed him by taking their side, but these incidents were generally so minor and had become so routine that his attention was not drawn to Udayaditya's existence unless something significant happened.
This time, he had begun to pay special attention to Udayaditya, so the aforementioned incident reached his ears immediately.
Hearing it, Pratapaditya became extremely enraged.
He summoned Udayaditya and said, “The reason I dismissed Sitaram and Bhagavat—was it only because the royal treasury lacked the funds to pay their salaries?
Then why have you fixed a monthly stipend for them on your own accord?”

Udayaditya said slowly, “I am the guilty one.
By punishing them, you have punished me.
According to that judgment of yours, I pay my penalty to them every month.”

Never before had Pratapaditya had to listen to Udayaditya's words with such attention.
Udayaditya's calm, grave, and humble tone and his well-composed words did not seem entirely unpleasant to Pratapaditya.
Without replying to Udayaditya’s words, Pratapaditya said, “I command, Uday, that they are not to be given any more financial help in the future.”

Udayaditya replied, “A more severe punishment has been ordered for me.”
But joining his hands, he said, “But what crime have I committed to deserve bearing such a great punishment?
How can I watch as eight or nine hungry mouths go without food because of me, as eight or nine unfortunate souls wander the streets crying, without shelter, while my own plate lacks no food?
Father, whatever I have is due to your grace.
You give me more food on my plate than I need, but if you seat eight or nine hungry, miserable people before me while I eat, yet forbid me from putting food in their mouths, then that food is poison to me!”

Pratapaditya did not interrupt the impassioned Udayaditya in the least while he spoke.
After he had finished, he said softly, “I have heard what you have to say, now I will say what I have to say.
I have stopped Bhagavat's and Sitaram's stipends, and if anyone else arranges a stipend for them, they will be considered to be acting against my will.”
A particular anger had risen in Pratapaditya's mind.
He probably did not understand the reason himself, but the reason was this: *It's as if I have committed some great cruelty, and so the very embodiment of mercy, Udayaditya, has come to remedy it.
Let me see what he can do with his mercy!
Where I am cruel, for anyone else to be merciful—who can bear such audacity!*

Udayaditya went to Surma and told her everything.
Surma said, “That day, they hadn't eaten anything at all.
In the evening, Sitaram’s mother came to me with Sitaram’s little girl and broke down in tears.
Only if I give them something in the evening can their whole family eat.
Sitaram's girl is just a babe, she hadn't eaten all day.
How could one even look at her face?
If we don't give them something, where will they go?”

Udayaditya said, “Especially since they have been driven from the palace, no one else will dare to give them work or help for fear of Father.
If we too turn away at this time, they will have no one left in the world.
I will certainly help them, don't worry about that, Surma, but it's not good to needlessly displease Father.
We must find a way to get this done secretly.”

Surma took Udayaditya’s hand and said, “You don't have to do anything more.
I will do everything, leave the burden to me.”

Surma wanted to shield Udayaditya with her own self.
This year was a bad one for Udayaditya.
Whatever task fate compelled him to undertake, it was all against his father; and yet, they were such tasks that a wife like Surma could not, in good conscience, stop her husband from doing them.
Surma was not that kind of wife.
When her husband goes to a righteous war, Surma straps on his armor with her own hands; afterwards, she goes to her room and cries.
Surma's heart was fraught with fear at every step, yet she gave Udayaditya courage at every step.
In times of grave danger, Udayaditya would look at Surma's face and see tears in her eyes, but Surma's hands did not tremble, her steps remained firm.

Surma arranged to send the stipends to Sitaram's mother and Bhagavat's wife through one of her trusted maids.
The maid was indeed trustworthy, but she did not consider it necessary to keep this matter secret from Mangala.
For this reason, no one on the outside was aware, except for Mangala.

## Chapter 16

When word of the secret stipends reached Pratapaditya's ears, he said nothing, but sent an order to the inner quarters that Surma must go to her paternal home.
Udayaditya steeled his heart.
Vibha wept, clinging to Surma's neck, and said, “If you go, what will I do in this graveyard of a palace?”

Surma held Vibha’s chin, kissed her face, and said, “Why would I go, Vibha?
My everything is here.”

When Surma heard Pratapaditya's order, she said, “I see no reason to go to my paternal home.
No one has come from there to fetch me, nor is it my husband’s wish.
Therefore, I see no need to suddenly go to my paternal home without cause.”

Hearing this, Pratapaditya erupted in fury.
But he reflected and saw he had no way.
Surma could not be forcibly thrown out of the house; physical force does not work in the inner quarters.
Pratapaditya was utterly inept when it came to women.
He knew how to apply force against force, but it never entered his head what moves to make regarding these defenseless women.
He could pull and snap great, thick ropes, but with his fat fingers, he could not undo the delicate knots of a slender thread.
These women were, in his opinion, utterly inscrutable and unworthy subjects of study.
Whenever any trouble arose concerning them, he would hastily hand the matter over to the Mahishi.
He had neither the time, the desire, nor the ability to sit and think about them.
It was a task entirely unsuited to him.
This time too, Pratapaditya summoned the Mahishi and said, “Send Surma to her father’s house!”

The Mahishi said, “But then, what will become of our Uday?”

Pratapaditya said irritably, “Uday is not a child.
For the sake of state affairs, I want to send Surma far from the royal palace.
This is my order.”

The Mahishi summoned Udayaditya and said, “My dear Uday, let’s send Surma to her father’s house!”

Udayaditya replied, “Why, Mother?
What crime has Surma committed?”

The Mahishi said, “How should I know, my child?
We are women, we understand nothing.
What advantage his state affairs will gain by sending my daughter-in-law to her father’s house, only the Maharaj knows.”

Udayaditya said, “Mother, what progress has been made in state affairs by causing me pain and making me miserable?
I have endured as much suffering as can be borne; what happiness is left for me?
It's not as if Surma is living in great happiness.
Twice a day she has endured scoldings; she has worn contempt and scorn like jewelry.
In the end, was there not even a little space for her in the royal palace?
Does she have no relationship with you, Mother?
Is she a beggar guest, whom you can keep when you please and drive out when you please?
If so, Mother, then there is no place in the royal palace for me either.
Bid me farewell too.”

The Mahishi began to cry, saying, “What can I say, my child?
I can never understand what the Maharaj is doing at any given time.
But, let me also say, my child, our daughter-in-law is not a very good girl either.
Ever since she entered this royal house, there has been no peace here.
It has been an utter torment.
So, why doesn’t she go to her father’s house for a few days?
Let’s see what happens.
What do you say, my child?
If she is gone for a few days, you will see whether the grace of this house returns or not!”

Udayaditya gave no further reply to this.
He sat silently for a while, then got up and left.

The Mahishi went weeping to Pratapaditya and fell at his feet, saying, “Maharaj, save us!
If Surma is sent away, Uday will not survive.
My son is not at fault.
It is that Surma, that witch, who has cast some spell on him.”
Saying this, the Mahishi was overwhelmed with tears.

Pratapditya, terribly enraged, said, “If Surma does not go, I will have Udayaditya imprisoned!”

Coming from the Maharaj, the Mahishi went to Surma and said, “You wretch, what have you done to my son?
Give me back my son!
What ruin have you not brought upon him since your arrival?
In the end—he is the son of a king—will you not be satisfied until you have put fetters on his hands?”

Surma shuddered and said, “Fettered, because of me?
What are you saying, Mother!
I will leave now!”

Surma went to Vibha and told her everything.
Clinging to Vibha's neck, she said, “Vibha, I am leaving now, and I believe they will never let me return here.”
Vibha wept and embraced Surma.
Surma sat down right there.
From the infinite edge of the infinite future, a single phrase began to strike her soul: “No more!”
I will not be allowed to return, there will be no more, nothing will remain!
Such a vast, empty future stretched out before her—a future in which that face was not there, that smile was not there, that affection was not there, no meeting of eye to eye, chest to chest, soul to soul, no exchange of joy and sorrow; even if her heart broke, not for a single moment was there a drop of love, of tenderness, nothing.
What a terrifying future!
Surma’s heart began to break, her head began to spin, her tears dried up!
The moment Udayaditya arrived, Surma clung to his feet, pressed them to her chest, and her heart broke as she burst into tears.
Surma had never cried like this before.
Her strong heart had shattered into a hundred pieces today.
Udayaditya lifted Surma’s head onto his lap and asked, “What is it, Surma?”

Looking at Udayaditya’s face, what more could Surma say?
She looked at his face and burst into tears again.
She said, “I will not be able to see that face?
Evening will fall, you will come and sit by the window, and I won’t be by your side?
The lamp will be lit in the room, you will come and stand by that door, and I will no longer smilingly take your hand and lead you in?
When you are here, where will I be?”

The way Surma said “where” held so much despair, such a sense of vast, distant separation!
When a meeting can only happen eye to eye, how great is the distance between!
When even that cannot happen, how much greater still!
When it takes time to even receive news, how much farther!
When, despite a life-or-death desire, you cannot meet for even a moment, then—then there is only bliss in clinging to these two feet, pressing them to the heart, and dying this very instant.

## Chapter 17

Rukmini was mentioned at the beginning of the story; readers have likely not forgotten her.
This Mangala is that same Rukmini.
Having left Raigarh and changed her name, she is living on the outskirts of Jessore.
There is nothing extraordinary about Rukmini.
Like a common woman of base nature, she is sensual, envious, and greedy for dominion over hearts.
Laughter and tears are at her beck and call; she brings them out when needed and puts them away when needed.
When she is angry, she is utterly ferocious; it seems as if she could tear the object of her anger to shreds with her teeth and nails.
At such times, she does not speak much; fire seems to shoot from her eyes, and she trembles violently.
Like molten iron, rage boils and bubbles in the cauldron of her heart.
Inside her mind, envy hisses like a snake, puffing up and thrashing its tail.
On the other hand, she performs various vows and various tantric rituals.
She understands the minds of the class of people she mixes with in a marvelous way.
The hope that when the Yubaraj ascends the throne, she will place her own throne upon his heart and rule over the kingdom of his heart and the kingdom of Jessore together, stirs in her heart in her waking and sleeping hours.
What is she not capable of doing for this!
After continuous effort over a long period, she has befriended all the servants of the palace.
She keeps track of every single trivial piece of news from the palace.
She hears even when Surma's face turns pale, and if Pratapaditya suffers a minor illness, it reaches her ears, and she thinks, perhaps this time the menace will die.
She has performed many rituals for the deaths of Pratapaditya and Surma, but nothing has succeeded yet.
Every morning she wakes up thinking that today she might hear that Pratapaditya or Surma is lying dead in bed.
Her impatience grows each day.
She thinks, to hell with mantras and tantras, if I can just get my hands on them once, I will satisfy my heart's desire.
While thinking this, she bites her lip so hard that it almost cuts and starts to bleed.

Rukmini saw that the King's and the Rajmahishi's animosity towards Surma was increasing daily.
It finally reached a point where a proposal was made to send Surma away from the palace.
Her joy knew no bounds.
When she saw that Surma still did not leave, she resorted to an easier method of sending her away.

When the Rajmahishi heard that a widow named Mangala knew various forms of tantra, mantra, and medicine, she thought it would be better to win the Yubaraj's heart back from Surma before sending her away.
She sent Matangini to secretly fetch medicine from Mangala.

Mangala took various roots and spent the entire night cutting, soaking, grinding, mixing, and chanting mantras to prepare a poison.

In that still, deep night, on the lonely outskirts of the city, inside the hidden hut, the sound of the mortar and pestle arose.
That sound became her only companion; that incessant, monotonous sound clapped in time with the rhythm of her dancing enthusiasm.
Her enthusiasm danced with double the vigor, and sleep left her eyes.

It took five days to prepare the medicine.
It does not take five days to prepare poison.
But it took a long time to chant the mantras and perform the rituals so that the Yubaraj would feel no pity when Surma died.

With Pratapaditya's consent, the Mahishi allowed Surma to stay in the palace for a few more days.
With Surma about to leave, Vibha saw a shoreless ocean all around her.
For these few days, she sat constantly by Surma's side.
Like a faded shadow, she silently followed Surma.
As each day passed and evening came, Vibha seemed to want to hold Surma in an ever-tighter embrace.
It was as if someone was forcefully tearing the days away from her desperate grasp.
Darkness surrounded Vibha!
To Surma's eyes too, everything was a void.
For her, there was no longer a north, south, east, or west; all directions in the world had merged into one.
She would lie at Udayaditya's feet, lie with her head in his lap, and silently gaze at his face, doing nothing else.
She tells Vibha, “Vibha, I am leaving everything I have with you,” and covering her face with both hands, she breaks down crying.

The afternoon was drawing to a close; tomorrow at dawn was the day of Surma's departure.
She handed over everything of her household, one by one, to Vibha.
Udayaditya sat there, calm and resolute.
He had decided that he would either keep Surma in the palace or he too would leave.
When evening fell, Surma could no longer stand; her legs trembled, and her head spun.
She went to the bedchamber and lay down, saying, “Vibha, Vibha, quickly call him!
There is not much time left.”

As soon as Udayaditya came to the door, Surma cried out, “Come, come, my heart feels strange!” and held out her arms.
As Udayaditya came near, she clasped his feet.
Udayaditya sat down.
By then, Surma was breathing with great difficulty; her hands and feet had grown cold.
Frightened, Udayaditya called, “Surma!”
Surma raised her head very slowly, looked at Udayaditya's face, and said, “What is it, my lord?”
Udayaditya asked anxiously, “What has happened, Surma?”
Surma said, “I believe my time has come,” and tried to raise her hands to embrace Udayaditya's neck, but her hands would not lift!
She just kept gazing at his face.
Udayaditya held Surma's face in his hands and said, “Surma, Surma, where will you go, Surma!
Who else is left for me?”
Tears streamed from Surma's eyes.
She only looked towards Vibha's face!
Vibha was then stupefied, staring at Surma with unseeing eyes.
The window in front of which Surma and Udayaditya used to sit every evening was open.
The stars were visible in the sky, a gentle breeze was blowing, and all around was quiet.
A lamp was lit in the room.
The sound of the conch and bell for the puja in the palace rose and gradually faded away.
Surma said to Udayaditya in a soft voice, “Say something, I cannot see very well.”

Gradually, the news spread through the palace that Surma was dying by her own hand, having taken poison.
The Rajmahishi came running, everyone came running!
Seeing Surma's face, the Mahishi cried out, “Surma, my child, you stay right here, you don't have to go anywhere.
You are the Lakshmi of our house, who told you to leave?”
Surma took the dust from her mother-in-law's feet and touched it to her head.
The Mahishi, crying twice as hard, said, “My child, did you leave in anger?”
By then, Surma's throat was choked; she tried to say something, but no words came out.
When four dandas of the night remained, the physician said, “It is over!”
“Sister, what has happened!” saying this, Vibha fell upon Surma's chest and clung to her.
Dawn broke, and Udayaditya remained seated, holding Surma's head in his lap!

## Chapter 18

Is Surma truly gone?
Why can't Vibha bring herself to believe it?
It is as if she will see Surma, as if Surma is somewhere just over there.
Vibha wanders from room to room, her very soul seeming to search for Surma.
When it is time to braid her hair, she sits quietly, as if Surma will come at any moment to braid it for her; she is waiting for her.
But no, evening has fallen, night is approaching, and it seems Surma will not come after all; her hair remains unbraided.
Today, Vibha’s face is so downcast, today Vibha is weeping so much, yet why has Surma not come?
Surma never does this!
The moment Vibha’s face looked even a little sad, Surma would come to her, take her by the neck, and gaze into her face, soothing her soul.
But today—oh, today, even if her heart were to break, she will not come.

Half of Udayaditya's strength, half his very life, was gone.
The one who was his hope in every task, his enthusiasm, whose counsel was his only support, whose smile was his only reward—she was gone!
He would go to his bedchamber, seem to ponder something, and glance around once, only to see—no one was there!
Slowly, he would come and sit at that window; he would leave the spot where Surma used to sit empty.
In the sky was the same moonlight, before him the same garden, the breeze blowing just as it did—and he would think, on such an evening, how could Surma possibly stay away?

Suddenly, it would seem to him that he heard a voice like Surma's.
He would startle, and though he knew it was impossible, he would look around, go to the bed, and see if anyone was there!
The Udayaditya who used to stay busy all day with hundreds of small tasks, to whom poor subjects would come with gifts of fruits, roots, and vegetables from their fields and gardens, and he would make inquiries about them, give them advice; these days he could do none of that, yet by evening he would be exhausted.
With weary steps, he would come to his chamber, a flicker of hope in his heart that as soon as he opened the door, he would see Surma sitting at that window.

When Udayaditya saw Vibha wandering about alone with a sorrowful face, his heart cried out.
He would call Vibha to him, caress her, speak so many words of affection to her, and finally, holding her brother's hand, Vibha would burst into tears, and tears would stream from Udayaditya's eyes too!

One day, Udayaditya called Vibha and said, “Vibha, who is left for you in this house?
Let me arrange to send you to your in-laws' home now.
What do you say?
Don’t be shy with me, Vibha!
To whom else can you express your heart's desire?”
Vibha remained silent.
She said nothing.
Did such a question even need to be asked?
Did she have any desire left to stay in her father's house?
For her soul to go to that one place of solace she had on earth, to that Chandradwip—would it not be restless?
But not a single person had come to fetch her!
Why had they not come?

Udayaditya once raised the proposal of sending Vibha to her in-laws' home before his father.
Pratapaditya said, “I have no objection to sending Vibha to her in-laws' home.
But if they had any affection for Vibha, they would have sent people to fetch her themselves.
I see no need for us to be so busy about it!”

The Rajmahishi would weep and wail upon seeing Vibha.
How could she bear to see Vibha's widowhood while her husband was still alive?
The sight of Vibha’s sorrowful face was like a spear in her heart.
Besides, the Mahishi was extremely fond of her son-in-law; that he had committed some childish act and its consequences would go this far, she did not like at all.
She went to the Maharaj and pleaded, “Maharaj, send Vibha to her in-laws' home!”
The Maharaj grew angry and said, “I have heard that same thing many times, do not bother me again.
When they beg for Vibha, they will get her!”
The Mahishi said, “If a daughter does not go to her in-laws' house for a long time, what will people say?”
Pratapaditya replied, “And—if Pratapaditya himself willingly sends his daughter and Ramchandra Ray turns her away from the door, then what will people say?”

Weeping, the Mahishi thought to herself that there was no telling what the Maharaja would do from one moment to the next.

## Chapter 19

King Ramchandra Ray was extremely sensitive to matters of honor and dishonor.
One day, the king was out on the road in his palanquin; two inexperienced weavers, who were sitting in front of their hut weaving, did not stand up when they saw the palanquin, and the king created a huge fuss about it.
On another occasion, he had ordered a servant from his father-in-law's house in Jessore to do some task.
The poor fellow misheard and made a mistake in his work.
From this, the greatly honorable Ramchandra Ray concluded that the servants of his father-in-law's house did not respect him, that they must have learned this from their masters, otherwise they would not dare.
Moreover, just that morning he had seen Yubaraj Udayaditya whispering something to that servant—of course, they must have been plotting to insult him, what else could it be!
One day, some boys had built a throne of mounded earth and were playing at court, dressing up as king, minister, and courtiers.
When this reached the king's ears, he summoned their fathers and gave them a sound punishment.

Today, the Maharaja is leaning against a bolster on his throne, smoking his hookah.
A timid, poor culprit stands before him, his trial underway.
The man had somehow heard about the incident concerning Pratapaditya and Ramchandra Ray and had discussed it amongst his own people.
An enemy of his heard this and brought the matter to the king's ears.
The king became furious and summoned him.
It seemed a great affair was brewing, whether he would be hanged or exiled.

The king is saying, “You wretch, you have such audacity!”

Crying, the man says, “Mercy, Maharaj, I did no such thing!”

The minister says, “You wretch, to compare Pratapaditya with our Maharaj!”

The Dewan says, “You wretch, don't you know that when Pratapaditya's father first became king, he had to appeal to our Maharaj's late grandfather for the royal anointment?
After much weeping and pleading, he anointed him with the little toe of his left foot.”

Ramai Bhand, the jester, says, “Pratapaditya is the son of Vikramaditya; they have been kings for only two generations!
Pratapaditya's grandfather was an earthworm, the son of the earthworm became a leech, and that wretch grew monstrously bloated by sucking the blood of his subjects.
Now, the son of that leech has made his head as wide as a winnowing fan by banging it on the ground and has learned to spread its hood like a snake.
We have served as jesters in the royal court for generations; we are snake-charmers—do you think we don't know a true snake?”

King Ramchandra Ray, immensely pleased today, began to smoke his hookah with a smiling face.
Nowadays, an attack on Pratapaditya occurs in the court every day.
The session adjourns only after the quivers of the courtiers are emptied of their piercing verbal arrows aimed at Pratapaditya's back.
In any case, in today's trial, after the offender cried and pleaded extensively, the formidable Ramchandra Ray said— “Alright, go—you are spared this time.
Be careful in the future!”

The other courtiers left; only the minister and Ramai Bhand remained with the king.
The conversation continued to be about Pratapaditya.

Ramai said, “You managed to get away, but Prince Udayaditya has landed in terrible trouble.
The king’s intention was that if his daughter became a widow, he could sell her iron and gold bangles to add some funds to the royal treasury.
The Yubaraj thwarted that plan.
What a fuss there was over it!”

The king began to laugh, saying, “Is that so!”

The minister said, “Maharaj, I hear that Pratapaditya is consumed with regret these days.
He has lost his appetite and sleep, worrying about how to send his daughter to her father-in-law's house.”

The king said, “Really!” and started laughing.
He smoked his hookah, feeling immense pleasure.

The minister said, “I told them, there is no need to send the girl to her in-laws' house anymore!
The fact that the Maharaja married into your family is enough to redeem your seven generations.
To then bring your daughter into our home and lower its status—you have not yet earned enough merit for such a thing!
Isn't that right, Thakur!”

Ramai said, “There is no doubt about it.
Maharaj, that you stepped in the mud was the mud's great fortune, but does that mean you won't wash your feet before entering the house?”

In this manner, the jesting and ridicule continued.
Placing imaginary figures of Pratapaditya and Udayaditya before them, they proceeded to tear them to shreds.
What Udayaditya’s crime was, I cannot understand.
The fact that he had ignored his own danger to save Ramchandra Ray's life—all of that went up in smoke, and for the crime of being Pratapaditya’s son, Ramchandra Ray brought up his name and laughed and joked without a care.
It is not that Ramchandra Ray was cruel; he was a fickle, small-minded man.
He was not grateful that Udayaditya had saved his life.
He felt that it was bound to happen; for it not to happen would have been wrong.
If Ramchandra Ray was in peril, would not everyone unite to save him?
He felt that if a thorn pricked his foot, the entire world would feel the pain in its soul.
He could not imagine that to even the most insignificant person on earth, their own troubles meant Maharaja Ramchandra Ray was nothing.
Day and night, placing the world on one side of the flatterers' scales and himself on the other, he had decided that he himself was heavier in weight; for this reason, gratitude towards anyone else did not easily arise in him.
Besides, there was another reason for the absence of gratitude towards Udayaditya: he believed Udayaditya had saved him for the sake of his own sister; saving his life had not been Udayaditya’s main objective.
Moreover, even if a sense of gratitude had arisen in Ramchandra’s heart, he would not have failed to make fun of Udayaditya.
This was because in a place where ten people were gathered to mock one person, especially when Ramai Bhand was leading the ridicule, he did not have the mental strength to either shut them up or refrain from joining in.
He would think, 'What will everyone think then?'

Even now, Ramchandra Ray had a feeling akin to infatuation for Vibha.
Vibha was beautiful, Vibha had just stepped into her youth, and Ramchandra Ray had met with Vibha for only a very few days.
He had shown contempt for Pratapaditya—but when he suddenly awoke that night and saw Vibha sitting on the bed crying, moonlight falling on her face, her half-bare chest heaving with sobs, tears flowing from her sweet, sorrowful eyes, her two small lips trembling like tender new leaves, a sudden surge of something erupted in his mind; he laid Vibha’s head in his lap, wiped away her tears, and an urge arose in his heart to kiss her sorrowful lips.
In that very instant, for the first time, a jolt of electricity coursed through his body; for the first time, he saw the wealth of beauty in Vibha’s newly blossomed youth.
For the first time, his belief flowed with force, a line of tears appeared on his half-closed eyelids, and his heart began to beat rapidly.
He went to kiss Vibha.
Just then, there was a knock on the door; just then, he heard the news of danger.
That first blossoming of the heart, that first surge of desire, that mesmerizing gaze of the eyes—because they remained unfulfilled, they lingered, thirst-stricken, and took possession of Ramchandra Ray's memory.
This was not the feeling of permanent love, for that was not possible for Ramchandra Ray’s fickle heart.
It was a feeling similar to the sudden attraction a connoisseur's heart feels for a luxury item, which the connoisseur Ramchandra Ray had developed for Vibha.
In any case, for whatever reason, Vibha lingered in Ramchandra Ray’s youthful dreams.
A desire to have Vibha had arisen in him.
But if he sent for Vibha, what would everyone think?
The courtiers would think him uxorious, the minister would be silently displeased, Ramai Bhand would laugh to himself!
Besides, what punishment would that be for Pratapaditya?
How would he have taken his revenge on his father-in-law?
Thinking about all this, he had neither the courage nor the inclination to send for Vibha.
In fact, when the jokes about Vibha went on, he did not have the courage to stop them, and remembering Pratapaditya, he had no desire to stop them either.

After Ramai Bhand and the minister had left, Rammohan Mal came and said with folded hands, “Maharaj!”

The king said, “What is it, Rammohan!”

Rammohan said, “Maharaj, give the order, let me go and bring the Thakurani back.”

The king said, “What are you saying?”

Rammohan replied, “Yes, your command.
The inner quarters are empty, and I cannot bear to see it.
When I go to the inner quarters, I see no one in your chambers, and my very soul feels uneasy.
Let my Ma-Lakshmi come home and brighten the house, that we may bless our eyes with the sight of her.”

The king said, “Rammohan, have you gone mad?
You want me to bring that girl into my house?”

Rammohan, his eyes wide, said, “Why, Maharaj?
What crime has my Ma-thakurani committed?”

The king said, “What are you saying, Rammohan?
That I should bring Pratapaditya’s daughter into my house?”

Rammohan replied, “And why should you not?
What is her connection to Pratapaditya now?
A girl belongs to her father until she is married; after the wedding, her father has no more claim on her.
Now, your Mahishi is yours—if you do not bring her home, if you do not honor her, then who will?”

The king said, “It is enough that I have married Pratapaditya’s daughter.
And now I should bring her into my house?
How will my honor be saved then?”

Rammohan retorted, “Honor?
You have left your own queen abandoned in another’s house, where you have no authority over her, where other people can lord over her as they please—is this how your honor is being saved?”

The king said, “And what if Pratapaditya refuses to give his daughter?”

Rammohan puffed out his great chest and declared, “What did you say, Maharaj?
If he refuses?
Who has such audacity that they would refuse?
My mother, the Ma-Lakshmi of our house—who has the power to keep her from us?
No matter how great Pratapaditya may be, I will snatch her from his hands.
I have said it.
I will bring my mother back; who are you to forbid it?”
So saying, Rammohan made to leave.

The king quickly said, “Rammohan, don’t go, listen, listen!
Alright, you may go and bring the Mahishi, I have no objection, but—see here—make sure no one hears of this.
This matter must not reach the ears of Ramai or the minister!”

Rammohan said, “As you command, Maharaj!” and left.

Although everyone would find out as soon as the Mahishi arrived in Rajpur, that was still a long way off.
There would be time to prepare for that.
For now, if Ramchandra Ray could just escape the grasp of immediate shame, he would be saved.

## Chapter 20

Day and night, Vibha’s only effort was to find a way to make Udayaditya happy.
She did all his work with her own hands.
She herself brought his food, sat before him during his meal, and did not allow even the slightest thing to be amiss.
When Udayaditya came to his room in the evening and sat with his eyes covered by both hands—perhaps with tears streaming from them—Vibha would quietly come and sit by his feet.
She would try to start a conversation, but no words would come.
The two of them were silent; not a word passed their lips.
The light of the dim lamp flickered from time to time, and with it, a dark shadow trembled on the wall.
After staring silently at that shadow for a long time, Vibha would let out a heart-rending sigh and cry out, “Brother, where has she gone?”
Udayaditya would be startled, remove the hands covering his eyes and stare at Vibha’s face, as if he had not quite understood what she had said, as if he were trying to comprehend it.
Suddenly, he would come to his senses, quickly wipe his tears, and coming to Vibha, say, “Come, Vibha, let me tell you a story!”

It was a day of monsoon rains—heavily overcast; rain had been falling in a steady patter all day.
The day was dark, and the plants in the garden stood still, getting drenched.
Now and then, a gust of wind would blow, and a spray of rain would enter the room.
Udayaditya sat in silence; thunder rumbled in the sky, and lightning struck on the horizon.
The incessant sound of the rain seemed to say only, “Surma is not here—she is gone.”
At times, the damp wind would come rushing with a whoosh, as if to say, “Where is Surma!”
Vibha would slowly approach Udayaditya and say—“Brother!”
Her brother could no longer answer; upon seeing Vibha, he covered his face and rested his head on the window frame, the rain falling upon him.
In this way the day passed, evening approached, and night began to fall.
Vibha, having arranged Udayaditya's meal, would come again and say, “Brother, the food has come, please eat!”
Udayaditya would not answer.
The night grew late.
Vibha would say through her tears, “Brother, get up, it is late.”
Udayaditya would lift his face to see Vibha crying; he would quickly get up, wipe Vibha’s eyes, and go to eat.
He did not eat properly.
Seeing this, Vibha would sigh and go to bed; she would not touch her food either.

Vibha would try to talk, to tell stories, but Vibha could not talk much; she could not figure out how to keep Udayaditya happy.
She only thought, ah, if only grand-uncle were here!

These days, a strange fear had taken hold of Udayaditya’s mind.
He was extremely afraid of Pratapaditya.
His former courage was gone.
He could no longer treat danger as a trifle and fight against oppression with all his might.
He hesitated in every task; doubt arose in every matter.

One day, Udayaditya heard that an order had been given to send club-wielding men at night to the estate office of the zamindar of Chhapra to loot it and set the building on fire.
Udayaditya immediately ordered his horse to be readied and went to the inner quarters.
Entering his bedchamber, he looked around once.
What was he thinking?
Lost in thought, he began to change his clothes absentmindedly.
He came outside.
A servant came and said, “Yubaraj, the horse is ready.
Where must we go?”
The Yubaraj stared at the servant's face absentmindedly for a while and finally said, “Nowhere.
Take the horse away.”

One day, hearing the sound of crying, Udayaditya came out and saw a royal official beating a subject who was tied to a tree.
The subject, crying, looked at the Yubaraj’s face and said, “Mercy, Yubaraj!”
The Yubaraj could not bear to see his suffering; he quickly ran and entered his house.
Before, he would have stopped the official without considering the consequences, would have tried to protect the subject.

The stipends for Bhagavat and Sitaram had been stopped.
The Yubaraj no longer had the courage to help them with money, either openly or secretly.
Whenever he heard of their hardship, he would think, “I will send the money today itself.”
Immediately after, he would begin to hesitate, and the money would never be sent.

Let no one think that Udayaditya was doing this out of fear for his life.
It is not that he had recently developed a greater attachment to life than before.
A blind fear had taken hold of his mind.
He regarded Pratapaditya as some kind of mysterious entity!
It was as if Udayaditya’s fate, every day and every moment of Udayaditya’s future life, was in Pratapaditya’s fist.
Even if Udayaditya were going to embrace death, standing in the final moments of his life, and Pratapaditya were to frown and order him to live, it seemed he would have to return from the jaws of death even then.

## Chapter 21

The widow Rukmini (Mangala) had some ready cash.
She earned her living by lending this money out at interest.
By the power of her beauty and silver, she kept many under her control.
Sitaram was a stylish man, yet there wasn't a penny in his house, which is why he had a sincere attraction to both Rukmini's beauty and her silver.
On days when there was no food in the house, you would see Sitaram, with a perfectly carefree expression, strolling down the street with a staff in hand and a thin shawl draped over his shoulders, his chest puffed out, on his way to Mangala's house.
If someone on the road asked, 'Well, Sitaram, how is life treating you?'
Sitaram would instantly reply without batting an eye, 'Wonderfully!
You are invited to our place for a meal tomorrow!'
Sitaram's grand pronouncements had not diminished in the slightest; rather, the worse his situation became, the more his words grew in length and breadth.
Sitaram's situation was indeed becoming quite bad.
It had recently reached a point where his uncle-in-law was contemplating giving up his honorary position and returning to his own land.

Today, having a special need for money, Sitaram came to Rukmini's house.
Smiling, he sidled up to her and said—

'Oh Rai, if you will give me alms,

I have no need for gold or silver,

I have come for my life's sake,

I beg for the jewel of your favor.'

No, my friend, that rhyme didn't quite work out.
I don't have much need for the jewel of your favor at the moment; if the need arises, we'll see later.
For now, a little gold and silver would be quite useful!'

Rukmini, suddenly feigning great affection, said, 'Well, if you need it, who else would I give it to if not you?'

Sitaram quickly said, 'No—it's not that I truly need it!
But you see, my friend, my mother keeps my money, I don't keep cash on me.
This morning, my mother went to her son-in-law's house in Joraghata.
She forgot to give me the money.
But I will pay you back tomorrow!'

Mangala laughed to herself and said, 'What's your hurry?
You can pay me back whenever it's convenient.
I'm giving it to your hands, I'm not throwing it in the water, am I?'
Had she thrown it in the water, there might have been some chance of getting it back; giving it to Sitaram, even that sliver of a chance was gone—that was the difference.

Seeing these signs of affection from Mangala, Sitaram’s love absolutely overflowed.
Sitaram set about being witty.
Playing the nawab without money and being a wit without humor were second nature to Sitaram.
He would say whatever came to his mind and, without waiting for anyone else, would start laughing himself.
His laugh was enough to make one laugh!
When he was a guard at the palace, altercations often threatened to break out between Sitaram and the other guards.
The main reason was that what Sitaram considered fun, not everyone else did.
Hanumanprasad Tewari was dozing off while on watch when Sitaram crept up behind him and suddenly struck such a blow on his back that the sting of that bone-breaking joke set both his back and his temper ablaze at once.
Sitaram laughed loudly, but Hanumanprasad did not join in the laughter; instead, with a clear example, he explained to Sitaram the difference between a punch and humor, and its connection to the sentiment of pathos.

It has already been said that Sitaram's affection suddenly overflowed.
He sidled up to Rukmini and said with affection, “You are my Subhadra, and I am your Jagannath.”

Rukmini said, “Oh, you man!
Subhadra is Jagannath’s sister!”

Sitaram replied, “How can that be?
If that were so, how did the Subhadraharan happen?”

Rukmini began to laugh.
Sitaram, puffing out his chest, said, “No, that won’t do, laughing won’t do, give me an answer!
If Subhadra was his sister, then how was she abducted?”

Sitaram believed that he had presented such a powerful argument that there was no room for further debate.

In a very sweet voice, Rukmini said, “Go on, you fool.”

Melting, Sitaram said, “A fool I am indeed.
Before you, my friend, I am always at a loss.
Before you, I will always be a fool!”
Sitaram thought to himself, 'I've given a great answer, the words came to me perfectly.'

He spoke again, “Alright, my friend, if you didn’t like that, tell me what you would be happy for me to call you!”

Rukmini said with a laugh, “Say ‘Pran’.”

Sitaram said, “Pran!”

Rukmini said, “Say ‘Priye’.”

Sitaram said, “Priye!”

Rukmini said, “Say ‘Priyatame’.”

Sitaram said, “Priyatame!”

Rukmini said, “Say ‘Pranpriye’.”

Sitaram said, “Pranpriye!”

“Alright, my dear Pranpriye, that money you gave me, how much interest will you charge?”

Rukmini got angry.
Pouting, she said, “Go on, go on, is this your love?
How could you bring yourself to ask about interest?”

Overjoyed and effusive, Sitaram said, “No, no, how can that be?
Was I being serious, my friend?
I was just joking, couldn’t you understand that?
Shame on you, Priyatame!”

I don't know what illness Sitaram's mother contracted, but nowadays he began visiting his in-laws' house quite often, and his memory of having to pay back money vanished completely.
Consequently, Sitaram had to visit Rukmini quite frequently.
Lately, Sitaram and Rukmini could be seen conferring together on some matter in great secrecy.
After many days of discussion, Sitaram said, “Brother, I’m not that good at scheming.
I won’t be able to proceed without Bhagavat’s help in this matter.”

That evening, a terrible storm was raging.
Doors throughout the palace were slamming shut.
The wind blew with such force that the branches of the large trees in the garden bent down to touch the ground.
Like shattered village debris in the mouth of a flood, torn clouds rushed across the face of the storm.
Frequent lightning, frequent thunder.
Udayaditya had bolted the doors all around and was sitting with a little girl on his lap.
He had extinguished the lamp in the room.
The room was dark.
The girl had fallen asleep on his lap.
When Surma was alive, she loved this girl dearly.
After Surma's death, the girl's mother had stopped sending her to the palace.
After a long time, she had come to visit the palace today.
Upon suddenly seeing Udayaditya, she had cried, “Uncle! Uncle!” and jumped into his lap.
Udayaditya had clutched her to his chest and brought her to his bedchamber.
Udayaditya's thought was this: “What if Surma comes to see this girl just once!
She loved her so much!
Could she stay away from one so dear?”
The girl asked once, “Uncle, where is Aunty?”

With a choked voice, Udayaditya said, “Why don’t you call for her once.”

The girl began to call out, “Aunty!
Aunty!”

It seemed to Udayaditya that someone had answered.
As if someone called out from a distance, “I’m coming, dear!”
As if, hearing the sorrowful call of the affectionate child, the loving woman could no longer stay away and was coming to take her into her arms.
The girl fell asleep on his lap.
Udayaditya extinguished the lamp.
He sat alone in the dark room, holding a sleeping girl on his lap.
Outside, the wind howled.
There were creaking sounds here and there.
Was that not the sound of footsteps?
It was indeed footsteps.
His heart was pounding so hard that he could not hear the sound properly.
The door opened, and lamplight entered the room.
Is this even possible!
A woman holding a lamp quietly entered the room.
Udayaditya, closing his eyes, whispered, “Surma?”
Lest Surma leave if he looked at her.
Lest it not be Surma.

The woman put down the lamp and said, “Why, my dear, do you not remember me anymore?”

It was as if a clap of thunder shattered his dream.
Udayaditya, startled, sat up and opened his eyes.
The girl woke up, cried out “Uncle,” and began to weep.
Laying her on the bed, Udayaditya stood up.
He seemed unable to decide what to do or where to go.
Rukmini came closer and, with a toss of her head, said, “I say, of course you won’t remember me now.
But why did you once give me hope and raise me to the skies?”
Udayaditya remained standing in silence, unable to say a word.

Then Rukmini brought out her Brahmastra.
Crying, she said, “What wrong have I done to you, that I have become a thorn in your side?
It was you who ruined me.
The woman who once sold her body and soul to the Yubaraj now wanders the streets like a beggar.
Is this what Providence had written on my cursed forehead?”

This time, the blow struck Udayaditya's heart.
It suddenly occurred to him that perhaps he had indeed ruined her.
He forgot the past.
He forgot how, in the folly of his youth, Rukmini had tempted him at every step, how she had laid a trap in his path every day, how, like a whirlpool, she had encircled him with her two enchanting arms, spinning him round and round before casting him into the darkness of the abyss in an instant—he forgot all of it.
He saw Rukmini’s clothes, soiled and torn; Rukmini was crying!
The kind-hearted Udayaditya said, “What do you want?”

Rukmini said, “I want nothing else, I want your love.
I want to sit at that window with my head on your chest and receive your affection.
Why, dear, is this face darker than Surma’s?
And if it has become dark, it is from wandering the streets for your sake.
It was not dark before.”

Saying this, Rukmini went to sit on Udayaditya's bed.
Udayaditya could bear it no longer.
He cried out in anguish, “Do not sit on that bed, do not sit!”

Rukmini raised her head like a wounded serpent and said, “Why shouldn’t I sit?”

Udayaditya blocked her path and said, “No, do not go near that bed!
Whatever you want, I will give it to you right now.”

Rukmini said, “Alright, give me that ring on your finger.”

Udayaditya immediately pulled the ring from his hand and threw it down.
Rukmini picked it up and went out.
She thought to herself, ‘The witch’s enchanting spell has not yet faded.
Let a few more days pass, then my mantra will work.’
After Rukmini left, Udayaditya collapsed onto the bed.
Hiding his face in his arms, he cried, “Where, where is Surma!
Who will bring peace to this scorched, thunderstruck heart of mine today?”

## Chapter 22

Bhagavat's situation was not very good.
For several days, he sat quietly, incessantly smoking his hookah.
When Bhagavat smoked with such concentration, it was a cause for alarm among his neighbors.
Because, just as dark smoke coiled and rose from his mouth, a workshop of similarly dark, coiling schemes would be at work inside his mind.
But Bhagavat was a very devout man.
His only fault was that he did not mix with anyone; he kept to his rosary of Hari's name, did not speak much, and did not engage in gossip.
But when someone fell into grave danger, no one else could give advice as sound as Bhagavat's.
Bhagavat never willingly harmed another, but if someone harmed him, he would never forget it in this lifetime; he would only set down his hookah after taking his revenge.
In short—in worldly terms, Bhagavat was what you would call a good man!
The neighborhood people also respected him.
Bhagavat had taken loans during his hard times, but he had paid them off by selling his pots and pans.

One morning, Sitaram came and asked Bhagavat, “Brother, how are you?”

Bhagavat replied, “Not well.”

Sitaram said, “Why do you say that?”

After taking a few puffs of his hookah, Bhagavat handed it to Sitaram and said, “I've fallen on very hard times.”

Sitaram said, “Really?
How did that happen?”

Feeling a little annoyed, Bhagavat said, “How did that happen?
Do I really need to tell you?
I thought I was in the same boat as you!”

Sitaram, somewhat embarrassed, said, “No, brother, that's not what I meant.
I was saying, why don't you take a loan?”

Bhagavat said, “If I take a loan, I'll have to repay it.
What will I repay it with?
I don't have many things left to sell or pawn.”

Sitaram said proudly, “How much money do you need?
I will give it to you.”

Bhagavat said, “Is that so?
Well, if you have so much money that throwing a handful into the water wouldn't make a difference, then give me ten or so.
But I'm telling you beforehand, I don't have the means to repay it!”

Sitaram said, “You don't have to worry about that, brother.”

Receiving the hope of such help from Sitaram, Bhagavat was not exactly overcome with an outpouring of friendship.
He packed another bowl of tobacco, sat down quietly, and began to smoke.

Sitaram slowly brought up the subject— “Brother, the king's unjust decision has destroyed our livelihood.”

Bhagavat said, “Really?
Your demeanor doesn't suggest that!”
Sitaram's generosity did not sit well with Bhagavat; he was feeling rather irritated!

Sitaram said, “No, brother, I'm just making conversation!
If not today, then in ten days, it will be gone.”

Bhagavat said, “Well, if the king makes an unjust decision, what can we do?”

Sitaram said, “Ah, when the Yubaraj becomes king, it will be the reign of Ram in Jessore.
May we live to see that day.”

Bhagavat, getting angry, said, “What business do we have with such talk, brother?
You are a big shot, you can sit in your house and play at deposing kings and ministers, that suits you—I am a poor man, I don't have such courage!”

Sitaram said, “Why are you getting angry, brother?
Just listen to what I have to say.”
And he began to whisper something.

Bhagavat, becoming furious, said, “Look, Sitaram, I am telling you plainly, do not utter such words to me.”

Sitaram left for the day.
Bhagavat, with great concentration, spent the whole day thinking about something.
The next morning, he himself went to Sitaram.
He said to Sitaram, “That idea you mentioned yesterday was a very solid one.”

Sitaram, puffing up with pride, said, “Didn't I tell you, brother!”

Bhagavat said, “I have come today to consult with you on that matter.”

Sitaram became even more proud.
For several days, they consulted continuously.

What they decided after consultation was this: a forged petition had to be written, as if the Yubaraj were lodging a complaint of treason against Pratapaditya with the Emperor in order to get the kingdom for himself.
It would be printed with the Yubaraj's seal.
The ring that Rukmini had brought had a seal with the Yubaraj's name engraved on it, so the work was already well advanced.

The plan was put into action.
A forged petition was written and stamped with the Yubaraj's name.
The foolish Sitaram could not be trusted, so it was decided that Bhagavat himself would take the petition and deliver it into the hands of the Dillishwar.

Taking the petition, Bhagavat went not toward Delhi, but to Pratapaditya.
He said to the Maharaj, “A servant of Udayaditya was taking this petition toward Delhi.
I found out about it through certain channels.
The servant has fled the country, and I have brought the petition to Your Majesty.”
Bhagavat did not mention Sitaram's name.
There is no need to describe what state Pratapaditya was in after reading the petition.
Bhagavat got his job back at the palace.

## Chapter 23

A darkness had descended upon Vibha's soul.
It was as if a heart-piercing sorrow, a desert-like despair, the renunciation of all life's happiness, was waiting for her in the future, drawing closer with every moment.
A shadow of that dreaded fate—a dry, limitless future that consumes all life and existence—seemed to have fallen upon Vibha's heart.
Vibha's mind was in turmoil.
Vibha was lying alone on her bed.
At this time, there was no one with her.
With a sigh, Vibha wept, and in her anguish, she said, “Have you then abandoned me?
What crime have I committed against you?”
Crying, she kept asking, “What crime have I committed?”
Covering her face with both hands, clutching a pillow to her chest, she wept and repeated over and over, “What have I done?”
“Not a single letter, not a single person has come, I hear no news from anyone.
What am I to do?
My heart is breaking, I pace restlessly from room to room all day, no one tells me any news of you, I do not hear your name from anyone's lips!
Oh, mother, how will the days pass!”

Many days passed like this.
On so many afternoons, so many evenings, so many nights, the companionless Vibha would wander through the empty rooms of the palace like a gaunt shadow.

Then one morning, Rammohan arrived and, bowing, said, “Victory to you, my lady!”
Vibha was so startled, it was as if a joyous thunderbolt had struck her.
Tears welled up in her eyes.
She said in surprise, “Mohan, you've come!”

“Yes, mother.
I saw that our mother has forgotten us, so I came to remind her!”

Vibha thought of many things she wanted to ask, but she could not out of shyness—she was on the verge of speaking, but the words would not come—yet her soul remained desperate to hear.

Rammohan looked at Vibha’s face and said, “Why, mother, why does your face look so sorrowful?
You have dark circles under your eyes.
There is no smile on your face.
Your hair is unkempt.
Come, mother, come to our home.
It seems there is no one here to care for you!”

Vibha smiled a pale smile; she said nothing.
As she smiled, the smile faded.
Tears began to stream from her two eyes—they flowed down her gaunt, pale cheeks, and the tears would not stop!
After many days of neglect, the slightest show of affection caused her wounded love to well up, and Vibha burst into tears, overcome by that tender, gentle, and deeply affectionate grievance.
In her heart, she said, “After all this time, have you finally remembered me?”

Rammohan could not bear it any longer; tears came to his eyes as well.
He said, “What an ill omen this is!
Our Ma-Lakshmi, come to our home with a smile on your face.
Wipe your tears on this auspicious day!”

The Mahishi had secretly feared that her son-in-law would not take her daughter back.
When she heard that Rammohan had come to take Vibha, she was overjoyed.
She summoned Rammohan and asked after the well-being of her son-in-law's household, fed him with special care, and listened to his stories.
The day passed in happiness!
The next day was auspicious for a journey; it was decided that Vibha would be sent off the very next morning.
Pratapaditya raised no further objections in the matter.

When all was settled for the journey, Vibha went to see Udayaditya one last time.
Udayaditya was sitting alone, lost in some thought.

Seeing Vibha, he was slightly startled and said, “Vibha, so you are leaving?
That is for the best!
You will be able to live happily.
I bless you—may you be like Lakshmi and brighten your husband's home!”

Vibha fell at Udayaditya's feet and began to weep.
Tears streamed from Udayaditya's eyes; placing a hand on Vibha's head, he said, “Why are you crying?
What happiness did you have here, Vibha?
There is only sorrow, hardship, and grief all around.
You have escaped this prison—you are saved!”

When Vibha stood up, Udayaditya said, “You are going?
Then come.
When you go to your husband's house, don't forget us completely.
Think of us from time to time, let us have news of you now and then.”

Vibha went to Rammohan and said, “I cannot go now!”

Rammohan asked in astonishment, “What are you saying, mother?”

Vibha said, “No, I cannot go.
I cannot leave my brother all alone now.
It is because of me that he has so much pain and sorrow, and now I am to leave him here to go and enjoy my own happiness?
As long as there is even a speck of sorrow in his heart, I too will stay by his side.
Who will care for him here as I do?”
Saying this, Vibha wept and walked away.

A commotion broke out in the inner quarters.
The Mahishi came and scolded Vibha; she frightened her with many threats and gave her much advice, but Vibha only said, “No, mother, I cannot!”

Crying with rage and irritation, the Mahishi said, “I have never seen such a girl anywhere!”
She went to the Maharaj and told him everything.
The Maharaj said with a tranquil air, “Well, that’s fine.
If Vibha does not wish to, why should she go?”

The Mahishi, astonished, threw up her hands and gave up completely, saying, “Do whatever you all wish, I will have no more part in this matter.”

Udayaditya was surprised to hear all this.
He came and tried at length to make Vibha understand; Vibha just cried silently, not understanding his reasoning!

The despairing Rammohan came and said with a gloomy face, “Well, Ma, I shall take my leave.
What shall I tell the Maharaj when I go to him?”

Vibha could not say anything, remaining silent for a long time!

Rammohan said, “Then I bid you farewell, Ma!”
He bowed and started to leave.
Vibha broke down completely and cried out in anguish, calling in a pained voice, “Mohan!”

Mohan turned back and asked, “What is it, Ma?”

Vibha said, “Tell the Maharaj to please forgive me.
He himself is calling for me, yet I could not go—it is only due to my terrible misfortune!”

Rammohan replied curtly, “As you command!”

Rammohan bowed again and departed.
Vibha saw that Rammohan had not understood her feelings at all; it had all struck him as terribly confusing.
For one thing, Vibha could not go where her heart longed to go; on top of that, Rammohan, for whom she held genuine affection, had left in anger today.
Only Vibha knew what her heart went through!

Vibha stayed.
Wiping her tears and carrying a weight of stone in her heart, she remained by her brother’s side.
Like a pale, thin shadow, she silently did all the work of the household.
When Udayaditya spoke to her with affection and endearment, she would lower her eyes and give a small smile.
In the evening, she would sit at Udayaditya’s feet and try to speak a little.
When the Mahishi scolded her, she stood and listened silently, eventually drifting away like a patch of gloomy cloud.
When someone would hold her chin and ask, “Vibha, why are you getting so thin?”
Vibha would say nothing, only smile a little.

It was at this time that Bhagavat showed Pratapaditya the aforementioned forged petition.
Pratapaditya flew into a rage—then, after much consideration, he gave the order to have Udayaditya imprisoned.
The minister said, “Maharaj, it is impossible to believe that the Yubaraj has done such a thing.
Everyone who hears it is shocked and says such a thing should not even be heard.
It is not believable that the Yubaraj would do this.”

Pratapaditya said, “I don’t particularly believe it either.
But what is the harm in him staying in prison because of it?
As long as he is not subjected to any hardship there.
Guards will just be appointed to ensure he cannot do anything in secret.”

## Chapter 24

When Rammohan returned to Chandradwip and stood alone before the king with folded hands like a culprit, Ramchandra Ray's entire body burned with rage.
He had decided that after Vibha arrived, he would take revenge on his father-in-law by making a few sharp-edged remarks to her about Pratapaditya and his lineage.
What he would say, how he would say it, when he would say it—he had planned it all out in his mind.
Ramchandra Ray was not a brute; it was not his intention to torment Vibha in any way.
He was simply impatient for the pleasure of thoroughly embarrassing Vibha about her father.
In fact, so consumed was he by this anticipated pleasure that it never even occurred to him that there could be any obstacle to Vibha's arrival.
And so, seeing Rammohan return alone, Ramchandra Ray was utterly astonished and cried out, “What happened, Rammohan?”

Rammohan said, “Everything has been in vain!”

The king, startled, shot up and said, “You couldn’t bring her?”

Rammohan replied, “No, Your Majesty.
I set out at an inauspicious time!”

Furious, the king exclaimed, “Who told you to consult the time of your departure, you fellow?
I warned you again and again, yet you went with your chest puffed out, and today—”

Rammohan touched his forehead and said with a grim face, “Maharaj, it is the fault of my destiny!”

Ramchandra Ray grew even angrier and said, “An insult to Ramchandra Ray!
You fellow went to beg for her in my name, and Pratapaditya refused.
Such a great insult has never before befallen our dynasty.”

Then Rammohan raised his bowed head and said with a hint of pride, “Do not say such things.
If Pratapaditya had refused, I would have snatched her away.
I told you as much before I left.
Maharaj, when I go to carry out your command, do I fear Pratapaditya?
Pratapaditya may be a king, but he is not my king.”

The king asked, “Then why did it not happen?”

Rammohan remained silent for a long time; tears appeared in his eyes.

The king said impatiently, “Rammohan, speak quickly.”

Rammohan, with folded hands, said, “Maharaj—”

The king said, “What is it?
Speak.”

Rammohan said, “Maharaj, our lady mother did not wish to come.”
As he said this, tears began to fall from Rammohan’s eyes.
Perhaps these were the tears of a child's hurt pride.
Perhaps the meaning of these tears was—“I had such faith in my mother that, on the strength of that faith, I went with a puffed-out chest and great joy to bring her, and she did not come; my mother did not keep my honor.”
For whatever reason, the old Rammohan could not hold back his tears.

When the king heard this, he shot to his feet, his eyes bulging, and exclaimed, “Indeed—” For a long time, he could not utter another word.

“So she refused to come!
You wretch, get out!
Get out of my sight this instant!”

Rammohan left without saying a word.
He knew it was all his fault; therefore, receiving a fitting punishment was not unjust.

The king could not conceive of any way to take revenge.
He could do nothing to Pratapaditya, nor could he get his hands on Vibha.
Ramchandra Ray began to pace impatiently.

Within a couple of days, the news had spread far and wide in various forms.
The situation became such that his honor could not be preserved without taking revenge.
Even the subjects grew eager for retaliation.
They said, “An insult to our Maharaja!”
It was as if the insult had been felt personally by everyone.
Firstly, the instinct for revenge was naturally strong in Ramchandra Ray's mind.
On top of that, he began to think: if I do not take revenge, what will the subjects think, what will the servants think, what will Ramai Bhand think?
When he imagined Ramai laughing and mocking him about this with someone else, he became extremely agitated.

One day in court, the minister proposed, “Maharaja, you should take another wife!”

Ramai Bhand said, “And let Pratapaditya's daughter stay with her brother!”

The king looked at Ramai, laughed, and said, “You are right, Ramai.”

Seeing the king laugh, all the courtiers began to laugh as well.
Only Fernandez was annoyed; he did not laugh.
People like Ramchandra Ray are always busy protecting their honor, but they have no knowledge of what honor truly is or how it is to be protected.

The Dewanji said, “The minister has spoken correctly.
That will teach Pratapaditya and his daughter a good lesson.”

Ramai Bhand said—“For this auspicious occasion, don't forget to send an invitation to your current father-in-law, sir.
Otherwise, who knows, he might feel hurt!”
Saying this, Ramai winked.
Everyone in the court began to laugh; even those sitting far away who hadn't heard the words couldn't help but laugh as well.

Ramai said, “For the welcoming ceremony, among the married women, you should summon your mother-in-law from Jessore.
And, *mistannamitarejanah*—when you send a platter of sweets to Pratapaditya's daughter, send a couple of green bananas along with it.”

The king was beside himself with laughter.
The courtiers covered their faces with their shawls and contorted their faces as they laughed.
Fernandez got up unnoticed and left.

The Dewanji tried to make a joke, saying, “*Mistannamitare janah*—if sweets are destined only for the base people, then all the sweets will be used up in Jessore, leaving no one in Chandradwip worthy of eating them!”

No one found his words funny.
The king silently smoked his hookah, the courtiers remained grave, and Ramai stared at the Dewan in amazement.
One of the ministers even asked mournfully, “What are you saying, Dewanji sir?
Will the arrangements for sweets at the king's wedding be so meager?”
The Dewanji began to scratch his head.

All the wedding plans were finalized.

## Chapter 25

The place where Udayaditya had been confined was not a prison in the true sense.
It was a small building adjoining the palace.
To its right was a royal road, and to the east of that was a wide wall upon which guards patrolled back and forth.
In the room, a very small window had been cut.
Through it, a sliver of the sky, a bamboo grove, and a Shiva temple were visible.
When Udayaditya first entered the prison, evening had already passed.
He went and sat on the floor, his face near the window.
It was the monsoon season.
Clouds had gathered in the sky.
Water had pooled on the road.
In the silent night, an occasional traveler walked by, their footsteps making a splashing sound.
From the east, the incessant sound of the guards' footsteps reached his ears, like the sound of the prison's heartbeat.
As each watch of the night passed, a distant call could be heard.
There was not a single star in the sky; the bamboo grove Udayaditya was gazing at was completely covered in fireflies.
That night, Udayaditya did not lie down to sleep; he sat by the window, listening to the relentless footsteps of the guards.

Today, Vibha went to the palace garden in the evening.
In the palace, there were likely many people.
Servants and aunts were everywhere, asking at every turn, 'What happened, what's the matter?'
She had to account for every teardrop, and detailed interpretations and critiques of every long sigh would emerge.
Vibha probably couldn't bear it anymore and had run away to the garden.
The sun had risen within the clouds today and set within the clouds.
It was impossible to tell when the day had ended and evening had begun.
Towards the afternoon, a thin line of gold had appeared in the west, but it faded before the day was over.
Darkness deepened upon darkness.
The world was shrouded from horizon to horizon.
Darkness gathered so thickly over the heads of the dense rows of casuarina trees that the space between them was no longer visible; it seemed exactly as if a vast, sprawling, silent darkness was standing on a thousand long legs.
As night fell, the lamps of the royal palace went out one by one.
Vibha sat at the foot of a casuarina tree.
Vibha was naturally timid, but today she felt no fear.
It was just that as the darkness grew, it felt as though someone were snatching the earth away from her; as if someone had pushed her from happiness, from peace, from the shore of the world and its affairs; she had fallen into a bottomless ocean of darkness; she was sinking, descending, the darkness above her growing ever thicker, no ground beneath her feet, nothing around her—refuge, shore, the world—all receding farther and farther away.
It seemed to her that, little by little, a massive barrier was rising before her towards the sky.
So much was left behind on the other side.
Her soul felt anguished.
It was as if she could see everything on the other side; its sunlight, its games, its festivals, all were visible; yet someone was holding her back cruelly, with a harsh hand, who would not let her go to that side even if the veins of her heart were torn out.
It was as if Vibha had received divine sight today; as if Vidhata had written Vibha's future destiny upon this vast, dense, dark gloom, and Vibha sat alone in the infinite universe, reading it; that is why there were no tears in her eyes, her body was still, her gaze unblinking.
After the second watch of the night, a wind rose; the trees and plants in the darkness let out a desolate cry.
The wind began to weep in the distance with the voice of a child, a mournful hoo-hoo sound.
It seemed to Vibha as if far, far away, sitting on a seashore, Vibha's cherished children of hope, affection, and love were crying with outstretched arms, calling for her in anguish; they wanted to be held, but they could not see the path before them; it was as if their cries pierced through these hundreds of leagues, thousands of leagues of dense, still darkness to reach Vibha's ears.
Vibha's soul seemed to cry out in anguish, 'Who are you, who are you crying, where are you!'
In her mind, Vibha set out alone on this path of a thousand leagues of darkness.
She seemed to travel ceaselessly for a thousand years, but the path never ended, she saw no one;—only, standing in that airless, soundless, dayless, nightless, unpopulated, starless, horizonless great darkness, she would occasionally hear weeping from all around, and only the wind from afar would cry, 'Hoo—hoo!'

The entire night passed sleeplessly.
The next day, Vibha tried very hard to go to Udayaditya in the prison, but her entry was forbidden.
She cried a great deal all day long.
She even went to Pratapaditya himself.
Vibha clung to his feet.
With great difficulty, she received his consent.
The next day, before dawn had broken, Vibha rose from her bed and entered the prison cell.
She saw that Udayaditya had not slept on the bed.
He was sitting on the floor, his head resting against the casement, and had fallen asleep.
Seeing this, Vibha's heart felt like it would break with sobs.
She controlled her weeping with great difficulty.
Very slowly, silently, she went and sat near Udayaditya.
Gradually, the morning grew clear.
Birds began to sing from the nearby forest.
Travelers on the adjacent road sang as they walked.
A couple of guards, tired from their night watch, began to sing softly upon seeing the light.
The sound of conches and bells rose from the nearby temple.
Udayaditya suddenly startled awake.
Seeing Vibha, he exclaimed, 'What is this, Vibha, so early?'
Looking around the room, he said, 'What is this—where am I?'
Within a moment, he remembered where he was.
Gazing at Vibha, he sighed and said, 'Ah—Vibha, you've come?
I didn't see you at all yesterday, and I thought I might never see you all again.'

Vibha came to Udayaditya, wiped her eyes, and said, 'Brother, why are you sitting on the floor?
The bed is made on the cot.
It looks like you haven't even sat on it once.
Have you made the floor your seat for these two days?'
Saying this, Vibha began to cry.

Udayaditya said softly, 'If I sit on the cot, I can't see the sky, Vibha!
When I look at the sky through the window and see the birds fly, I think that my cage too will one day break, and I too will one day swim in that endless sky to my heart's content, just like those birds.
When I move away from this window, I see only darkness all around, and I forget that I will one day be free, that I will one day be liberated.
I can't imagine that the chains of my life will one day break, that I will one day be released from this prison.
Vibha, within this prison, there is this small patch of two hands' breadth of land where, as soon as I come, I know that I am naturally free; no king or emperor can hold me captive.
And over there, in that room, that soft bed—that is my prison.'

Seeing Vibha so suddenly today brought Udayaditya immense joy.
The moment his eyes fell on Vibha, it was as if all the doors of his prison had opened.
That day, he sat her down beside him and spoke with such joy, saying so many things that he had probably never said before his imprisonment.
Vibha could sense that joy in her heart.
I do not know how messages travel from one soul to another, by what law a wave in one soul creates a wave in another.
Vibha's heart filled with delight.
Her long-held purpose was fulfilled today.
Vibha was a simple girl, and after a long time, she suddenly understood today that she could give Udayaditya joy.
She found strength in her heart.
For so long, she had seen only darkness all around, she could find no shore, and she had been utterly bowed down by the heavy weight of despair.
She had no faith in herself; she constantly worked for Udayaditya but could not believe that she could make him happy.
Today, she suddenly saw a path, and all the weariness of the past days was forgotten at once.
Today, teardrops like morning dew appeared in her eyes; today, a pure smile like the rays of dawn bloomed on her lips.

Vibha too became almost a prisoner.
As soon as the morning light entered through the casement of the cell, the prison door would open and Vibha's pure form would appear.
Vibha wouldn't let the paid servants do anything; she did all the work with her own hands, she brought the food herself, she made the bed herself.
She brought a parakeet and hung it in the room and would bring flowers from the palace garden every morning.
There was a copy of the Mahabharata in the room, and Udayaditya would have Vibha sit beside him and read it aloud to her.

But a pain lingered inside Udayaditya's mind.
He was already on the verge of sinking, so why at such a time was he embracing the tender Vibha, with her incomplete happiness and unfulfilled hopes, as his refuge and dragging her down with him?
Every day he thought of telling Vibha, 'Go, Vibha!'
But when Vibha entered the prison with the morning breeze, with the morning light, holding the hand of the young dawn; when that beloved, tender face came and sat beside him, looked at his face with such care and affection, asked so many things in such a sweet voice, he could not bring himself to say, 'Vibha, go, don't come anymore, I won't see you again.'
Every day he thought, I will say it tomorrow; but that tomorrow would never seem to come!
Finally, one day, he made a firm resolve.
Vibha came, and he told her, 'Vibha, don't stay here any longer.
I can find no peace as long as you are here.
Every evening in the darkness of this prison, someone seems to come and tell me that danger is approaching Vibha.
Vibha, flee from my side quickly!
I am the planet Shani; the moment I am seen, dangers rush in from all directions.
Go to your in-laws' house.
I will be happy if I just get news of you from time to time.'

Vibha remained silent.

Udayaditya lowered his face and looked at Vibha's face for a long time.
Tears streamed from his eyes.
Udayaditya understood, 'Until I am freed from this prison, Vibha will never leave me.
How can I be freed!'

## Chapter 26

Ramchandra Ray concluded that Vibha had not come to Chandradwip solely because of Pratapaditya’s command and Udayaditya’s counsel.
The thought that Vibha might have refused of her own accord was a great blow to his self-esteem.
He thought, ‘Pratapaditya wants to insult me, therefore he will never send Vibha to me.
But why don't I turn this insult back on him?
Why don't I write him a letter saying that I have renounced your daughter, and she should not be sent to Chandradwip again?’
After much deliberation and consultation with five people, a letter to that effect was written to Pratapaditya.
To write such a letter to Pratapaditya was no act of ordinary courage.
Ramchandra Ray was quite afraid in his heart.
But just as it is impossible to stop midway while descending a steep mountain at high speed, a similar feeling had arisen in Ramchandra Ray's mind!—having suddenly embarked on a reckless course, it was as if he could not stop until he reached the very end.
Calling Rammohan, he said, “Take this letter to Jessore.”
Rammohan, with folded hands, replied, “Your Majesty, no, I cannot.
I have resolved not to go to Jessore again.
If you command me to go once more to bring back our lady mother, then perhaps I could go, but otherwise, I cannot take this letter.”
Saying nothing more to Rammohan, the king handed the letter to the old Nayanchand.
He set off for Jessore with that letter.

He took the letter, it is true, but Nayanchand was greatly afraid.
He did not know what Pratapaditya might do if this letter fell into his hands.
After much thought, he resolved to give this letter to the Mahishi.
The Mahishi’s state of mind was not good at all.
On one hand, she worried for Vibha, and on the other, she was pained for Udayaditya.
It was as if she had become completely overwhelmed by the chaos of the household.
She was often seen crying.
It seemed she no longer had any heart for her domestic duties.
It was in this state that she received the letter—she could not think what to do.
She could not say anything to Vibha; if she did, the delicate Vibha would not survive.
There was no telling what disaster would befall if word of this letter reached the Maharaj's ears.
Yet, in such a crisis, the Mahishi could not bear to live without telling someone, without seeking advice from anyone.
Seeing a shoreless ocean on all sides, the Mahishi went to Pratapaditya, weeping.
She said, “Maharaj, something must be done about Vibha.”

Pratapaditya said, “Why do you say that?”

The Mahishi said, “No, it’s not that anything has happened—but at some point or other, Vibha will have to be sent to her in-laws’ house!”

Pratapaditya—“I understand that, but why has this suddenly occurred to you today after all this time?”

The Mahishi said fearfully—“That’s just like you, what am I saying that anything has happened?
If something were to happen—”

Pratapaditya said in annoyance, “What more could happen?”

The Mahishi—“Just imagine if our son-in-law were to abandon Vibha completely.”
Saying this, the Mahishi’s voice choked, and she began to cry.

Pratapaditya became extremely angry.
Sparks of fire shot from his eyes.

Seeing the Maharaj in that state, the Mahishi wiped away her tears and said hurriedly, “But that is not to say that our son-in-law has actually written saying, ‘Hey, I have abandoned your Vibha, do not send her to Chandradwip anymore,’ that is not the case—the point is, what if one day he does write that!”

Pratapaditya said—“When that happens, I will take the appropriate measures.
For now, there is no time to worry about it.”

The Mahishi cried and said, “Maharaj, I fall at your feet, please grant me this one request.
Think for a moment what will become of Vibha!
My heart must be made of stone that it still endures, otherwise you have given me as much pain as one can be given.
Uday—my darling child—the son of a king—you have imprisoned him like a common criminal.
He does no wrong to anyone, he doesn't get involved in anything, his only fault is that he doesn't understand things, hasn't learned statecraft, doesn't know how to rule subjects, he has no cleverness, but whatever Bhagavan has made him, what is his fault in that?”
Saying this, the Mahishi cried twice as hard.

Pratapaditya, slightly annoyed, said, “That topic has been discussed many times.
Just stick to the matter at hand.”

The Mahishi struck her forehead and said, “It is my cursed fate!
What more can I say?
Do you ever listen when I speak?
Just look at Vibha’s face for once, Maharaj!
She says nothing to anyone—she just wastes away day by day, becoming like a shadow, but she doesn’t know how to speak up!
Do something for her.”

Pratapaditya grew annoyed—the Mahishi, saying nothing more, returned.

## Chapter 27

In the meantime, an incident had occurred.
When Sitaram saw that Udayaditya had been imprisoned, he was beside himself.
First, he went to Rukmini's house.
He cursed her with whatever came to mind.
He all but struck her!
He said, “You ruinous woman, I will set your house on fire, I will turn your home to ruins, and I will free the Yubaraj!
If I don't, my name isn't Sitaram!
I am leaving for Raigarh today.
After I return from Raigarh, I will grind that wretched face of yours on this stone floor, and I will not drink even water until I have smeared your face with lime and soot and driven you from this city!”

For a moment, Rukmini listened, staring at Sitaram's face with unblinking eyes.
Gradually, her teeth clenched and her lips pressed together.
Her fists tightened.
A cloud gathered over her thick, dark brows, and lightning began to collect in her deep black pupils.
Her entire body grew still.
Then, her full lower lip began to tremble, her thick brows furrowed, lightning played in her dark eyes, her hair seemed to bristle, and her hands and feet began to tremble violently.
A demonic curse, a trembling hatred that swelled through her entire body, seemed about to fall upon Sitaram's head.
At that very moment, Sitaram left the hut.
As Rukmini's fists gradually loosened, her teeth unclenched, her lips parted, and her furrowed brows smoothed, she sat down.
She said, “Is that so!
So the Yubaraj is *yours*, is he?
You are so hurt because the Yubaraj is in danger—as if he is nothing to me.
You wretched fool, don't you know that he is *my* Yubaraj?
Only I can do him good, and only I can do him harm.
You want to free my Yubaraj from prison?
We shall see how you manage that.”

That very day, Sitaram left for Raigarh.

In the afternoon, Basanta Ray was sitting on the veranda of his palace in Raigarh.
Before him lay a wide field.
At the edge of the field, beyond a canal, the sun was setting amidst a mango grove.
His eternal companion, the sitar, was no longer with him.
The old man gazed at the setting sun, humming a song to himself.

I alone am left behind.

What was there has gone away; what remains is only emptiness.

Those who were once mine,

No longer do they answer my call.

Where are they, where are they?
Weeping, whom shall I call?

Tell me, Mother, I ask you,

“Did you leave nothing of ‘mine’ for me?”

With only myself, with what spirit can I go on living?

Who knows what the old man was thinking as he sang this song.
Perhaps he felt: I am singing, but those I used to sing for are no longer here.
The song comes on its own, but there is no longer any joy in singing it.
He had not yet forgotten joy, but whenever joy arose, where were those whom he longed to embrace?
On days when clouds gathered over that palm tree in Raigarh, his heart would dance with joy, and on that very day, he would set out for Jessore to see his loved ones.
Would he never get to see them again?
Even now, his heart would sometimes leap with that same joy, but alas—perhaps it was these thoughts that made the song spontaneously rise to old Basanta Ray’s lips as he gazed at the setting sun that afternoon—“I alone am left behind.”

At that moment, Khan Saheb arrived and made a grand salute.
Seeing Khan Saheb, Basanta Ray's face lit up and he said, “Khan Saheb, come, come!”
Going closer, he asked with concern, “Saheb, why does your face look so sad?
Are you in good spirits?”

Khan Saheb said, “Do not ask about my spirits, Maharaj.
Seeing you so downcast, there is no more joy in our hearts!
There is a couplet—‘The night says I am nothing; the moon whom I carry on my head, with it I laugh, with it I fade.’—Maharaj, who are we?
If you do not smile, what power have we to smile?
We have no more joy, Janab!”

Basanta Ray said eagerly, “What are you saying, Saheb?
I have no ailment at all—I laugh at myself, I live in my own joy—what ailment do I have, Khan Saheb?”

Khan Saheb said, “Maharaj, we no longer hear your singing and music.”

Basanta Ray suddenly grew a little somber and said, “You wish to hear my song, Saheb?”

“I alone am left behind.

What was there has gone away,

What remains is merely an illusion.”

Khan Saheb asked, “You no longer play that sitar?
Where is your sitar?”

Basanta Ray smiled slightly and said, “It’s not that I don’t have the sitar.
The sitar is there, only its strings have broken, and it can no longer be tuned.”
Saying this, he looked towards the mango grove and began to stroke his head.

After a few moments, Basanta Ray cried out, “Khan Saheb, sing a song—sing a song, sing—‘Tajbe Taj Naube Nau.’”

Khan Saheb began the song:—

“Tajbe Taj Naube Nau.”

In no time, Basanta Ray was swept up in it—he could no longer remain seated!
He stood up and began to sing along, “Tajbe Taj, Naube Nau.”
He clapped the rhythm vigorously and sang it again and again.
As he sang, the sun set, darkness fell, and the cowherds, on their way home, began to sing.
At that moment, Sitaram arrived and, bowing, said, “Victory to the Maharaj!”
Basanta Ray was completely startled, immediately stopped singing, and hurried over to him.
Placing a hand on his shoulder, he said, “Oh, it’s Sitaram!
Are you well?
How is brother?
Where is sister?
Is the news good?”

Khan Saheb left.
Sitaram said, “I will explain it all one by one, Maharaj.”
And so, one by one, he told of the Yubaraj's imprisonment.
Sitaram did not tell the truth from beginning to end.
He was not very clear about the reason that had led to Udayaditya’s imprisonment.

The world came crashing down on Basanta Ray; he gripped Sitaram’s hand firmly.
His eyebrows shot up, his eyes widened, and his lips parted—staring at Sitaram’s face with an unblinking gaze, he said, “Eh?”

Sitaram replied, “Yes, indeed, Maharaj.”

After a moment of silence, Basanta Ray said, “Sitaram!”

Sitaram replied, “Maharaj!”

Basanta Ray asked, “Then where is Dada now?”

Sitaram said, “In prison, sir!”

Basanta Ray began to run a hand over his head.
It seemed the news of Udayaditya being in prison was not quite sinking in; he could not conjure the image of it at all.

After another short while, he grabbed Sitaram’s hand again and said, “Sitaram!”

Sitaram replied, “Yes, Maharaj!”

Basanta Ray asked, “Then what is Dada doing now?”

“What else can he do!
He is in prison.”

“Have they all locked him up?”

“Yes, indeed, Maharaj.”

“Does no one let him out, not even once?”

“No, sir.”

“Is he sitting alone in the prison?”

Basanta Ray did not ask these questions of any particular person.
He was speaking to himself.
Sitaram did not understand this—he answered, “Yes, Maharaj.”

Basanta Ray cried out, “Dada, come to me!
No one understood you.”

## Chapter 28

The very next day, Basanta Ray set off for Jessore, listening to no one's objections.
Upon reaching Jessore, he went straight to the inner quarters of the royal palace.
Vibha, upon suddenly seeing her grand-uncle, was completely overwhelmed.
For a moment, she seemed unable to think of what to do.
There was only wonder in her eyes, joy on her lips, no words from her mouth, her body motionless—she stood like that for a while—then she fell at his feet to offer her respects, taking the dust from his feet to her head.
After Vibha stood up, Basanta Ray looked at her face with an intensely focused gaze and asked, 'Vibha?'
He said nothing more, only asked, 'Vibha?'
It was as if a very faint hope had sprung up in his mind that what Sitaram had told him might not be true.
He was afraid to ask the whole thing clearly, lest Vibha give him the answer!
It was not his wish that Vibha answer his question immediately.
That is why, with great trepidation, he questioned her very face—'Vibha?'
That is why he looked at her face with such an intense gaze.
Vibha understood, and she too could not answer.
Her initial surge of joy had faded.
She remembered all those days when her grand-uncle used to visit!
What festive days those had been!
What joy would erupt when he arrived!
He would laugh and joke; Vibha would laugh but couldn't joke back; her brother, a picture of serene joy, would listen to their grand-uncle’s songs.
Today, her grand-uncle had come, but no one else came near him, only Vibha, alone in this dark household—alone, like the sole broken remnant of a happy family—stood before her grand-uncle.
The room from which sounds of joy would arise whenever her grand-uncle came—Surma's room—why was it like this today; today it was silent, dark, utterly empty.
It was as if the room itself would burst into tears at the sight of her grand-uncle!
Basanta Ray, with some sort of faint hope, went and stood before that room.
Standing near the door, he put his head inside and looked all around, then instantly turned his face away and asked in a heart-rending voice, 'Didi, is there no one in the room?'

Vibha burst into tears and said, 'No, grand-uncle, no one at all.'

The silent room seemed to cry out with a desolate wail—'Those who were here before are here no more!'

Basanta Ray stood silently for a long time.
Finally, taking Vibha's hand, he slowly began to sing—

'I alone am left behind!'

Basanta Ray went to Pratapaditya and pleaded earnestly, saying, “Baba Pratap, why do you torment Uday any longer—what has he done to you?
If you do not love him, if he offends you at every turn—then why not give him to this old man?
I will take him away—I will keep him—you will not have to see him anymore—he will stay with me!”

Pratapaditya listened to Basanta Ray’s words patiently for a long time.
Finally, he said, “Uncle, what I have done, I have done after much consideration.
On this matter, you certainly know far less than I.
And yet you have come to offer advice.
I cannot heed any of your words.”

Then Basanta Ray stood up, went to Pratapaditya, and took his hand, saying, “Baba Pratap, don’t you remember?
That I raised you in my arms as a child, do you not recall that?
From the day my late elder brother entrusted you to my hands, have I ever caused you a moment's pain?
When you were helpless in my care, did you ever, for even a day, feel that you were fatherless?
Pratap, tell me, what crime did I commit against you that you can cause me such pain in my old age?
I am not saying that you are indebted to me because I raised you—by raising you children, I was only trying to repay the debt of love I owed my brother.
Therefore, Pratap, I ask for nothing from you as my due, nor have I ever.
I am only begging for alms from you—will you not grant even that?”

Tears began to fall from Basanta Ray’s eyes.
Pratapaditya remained seated, like a stone statue.

Basanta Ray spoke again, “So you will not listen to my words—you will not grant my plea—?
Won't you answer me, Pratap?”—With a deep sigh, he said, “Very well—I have one more small request.
I wish to see Uday just once—let no one forbid me from entering his prison cell—give me this permission!”

Pratapaditya did not grant that either.
He had become extremely annoyed in his mind that Basanta Ray would show so much affection for Udayaditya, in defiance of him.
The more he felt that people were making him out to be the villain, the more obstinate he became.

Basanta Ray returned to the inner quarters, his face so dejected that it pained Vibha deeply to see him.
Vibha took her grand-uncle’s hand and said, “Grand-uncle, come to my room.”

Basanta Ray silently followed Vibha into her room.
After he sat down, Vibha touched his grey hairs with her delicate fingers and said, “Grand-uncle, come, let me pluck your grey hairs.”

Basanta Ray replied, “My dear, are there any grey hairs left to pluck?
When I wasn’t old, I had them, and I would ask you all to pull them out.
Today I have become an old man—I have no grey hairs anymore.”

Basanta Ray saw Vibha’s face fall and her eyes well up with tears.
He quickly changed his tune.
“Come, Vibha, come!
Pluck a few hairs.
I can’t keep up with supplying you all with grey hairs anymore, my dear.
I’m getting on in years and gradually going bald—now you must look for another head.
I have resigned!”
Saying this, Basanta Ray began to laugh.

A maidservant came and said to Basanta Ray, “Rani Ma wishes to pay her respects to you.”

Basanta Ray went to the Mahishi’s room; Vibha went to the prison.

The Mahishi bowed to Basanta Ray.
Basanta Ray blessed her, “Ma, may you live a long life.”

The Mahishi said, “Uncle, please do not give me that blessing anymore.
Now, death would be a relief for me.”

Basanta Ray said anxiously, “Ram, Ram!
You must not utter such words.”

The Mahishi said, “What else can I say, Uncle?
It is as if the gaze of Shani has fallen upon my household.”

Basanta Ray grew even more anxious.

The Mahishi said, “Seeing Vibha’s face, I have lost my appetite for food and water.
If I ask her, she says nothing, yet day by day her body is wasting away.
I cannot think what to do with her!”

Basanta Ray became extremely distressed.
“Look here, Uncle, a disastrous letter has arrived.”
Saying this, she placed a letter in Basanta Ray's hands.

Before Basanta Ray could finish reading the letter, the Mahishi began to weep, saying, “What happiness do I have left?
Uday—my poor child knows nothing, and the Maharaj has—it's as if he wasn't born to be a king, but I carried him in my womb, he is my own child after all.
I do not know how my child is faring in there; they will not even let me see him once!”
Nowadays, whatever topic the Mahishi brought up, the subject of Udayaditya would eventually find its place.
That particular sorrow was awake in her soul day and night.

After reading the letter, Basanta Ray was utterly stunned.
He sat in silence, rubbing his head.
After a moment, Basanta Ray asked the Mahishi, “You have not shown this letter to anyone, have you, Ma?”

The Mahishi replied, “If the Maharaj heard of this letter, would he spare anyone?
And would Vibha survive it?”

Basanta Ray said, “You have done well.
Do not show this letter to anyone else, Bou Ma.
You must send Vibha to her father-in-law’s house at once.
Do not think about honor or dishonor!”

The Mahishi said, “I have been thinking the same.
I have no use for honor; my only wish is for Vibha to be happy.
I only fear that they might neglect her.”

Basanta Ray said, “Neglect Vibha!
Is Vibha a treasure to be neglected?
Wherever Vibha goes, she will be cherished.
Where else is there such a Lakshmi, such a golden idol!
Ramchandra wrote this letter only out of anger at you all.
As soon as you send her back, his anger will subside!”
This is what Basanta Ray understood with his simple heart and simple mind.
The Mahishi understood it the same way!

Basanta Ray said, “Announce in the household that Ramchandra has written a letter requesting that Vibha be sent to Chandradwip.
Then Vibha will surely not object to going.”

## Chapter 29

After evening fell, Basanta Ray was sitting alone in the outer quarters.
At that moment, Sitaram came and bowed to him.

Basanta Ray asked him, “Well, Sitaram, what is the news?”

Sitaram replied, “I will tell you later; you must come with me.”

Basanta Ray said, “Why, where to, Sitaram?”

Sitaram then came closer and sat down.
He whispered something very softly.

His eyes widening, Basanta Ray exclaimed, “Is it true?”

Sitaram replied, “Yes, it is, Maharaj.”

Basanta Ray hesitated for a long time in his mind.
He said, “Must we go right now?”

Sitaram— “Yes, Maharaj!”

Basanta Ray— “Shouldn't I go see Vibha first?”

Sitaram— “No, Maharaj—there is no more time!”

Basanta Ray— “Where must we go?”

Sitaram— “Come with me, I will take you.”

Basanta Ray stood up and said, “Why shouldn't I just go and see Vibha?”

Sitaram— “No, Maharaj!
If we are late, everything will be ruined!”

Basanta Ray said quickly, “Then never mind—never mind!”
The two of them set off.

After going a little further, he asked again, “Can we not delay just a little?”

Sitaram— “No, Maharaj, that would lead to danger!”

Saying, “Durga,” Basanta Ray went out of the palace.

Udayaditya did not know that Basanta Ray had arrived.
Vibha had not told him, because when there was no possibility of them meeting, the news would only be a cause for his suffering.
After bidding him farewell in the evening, Vibha had left the prison.
Udayaditya was reading a Sanskrit text with a lamp.
The wind was coming through the window, the lamp's faint flame was flickering, and the letters were not clearly visible.
Insects were coming and falling onto the lamp.
Again and again, the lamp came close to going out.
Once, the wind came with a gust—the lamp went out.
Udayaditya closed the book and went to sit on his cot.
One by one, so many thoughts came to him.
He thought of Vibha.
Today, Vibha had come a little late and left a little early.
Today, he had seen her looking particularly somber; he was pondering this in his mind.
It was as if he had no one else on earth—all day long, he saw no one but Vibha—she was his only subject of contemplation.
Every one of Vibha’s smiles, every one of her words, was stored in his mind—just as a thirsty person savors every single drop of his drink, so too did he savor the slightest sign of Vibha's affection with his heart and soul.
So today, lying alone in this solitary, small, dark room, he was thinking of the sad face of Vibha, the very idol of affection.
Sitting in that darkness, it occurred to him—"Is Vibha gradually growing weary of this?
Does she no longer enjoy serving a gloomy, dark figure in this joyless prison?
Will she increasingly see me as an obstacle to her happiness—a thorn on the path of her life?
Today she came late—tomorrow perhaps she will come even later—and then one day, perhaps I will be sitting all day waiting for Vibha to come—afternoon will turn to evening—evening will turn to night, and Vibha will not come!—And after that, perhaps Vibha will not come at all."
As this thought continued to rise in Udayaditya’s mind, a gaping void seemed to open up in his heart—he saw the world of his imagination become terrifyingly empty.
A day would come when Vibha would look at him with eyes devoid of affection, as the thorn in her happiness—the mere hint of that distant fantasy made his heart utterly distraught.
At one point he thought, "How terribly selfish I am!
The enmity I am showing Vibha out of my love for her is something perhaps not even an enemy could inflict."
Again and again, he resolved not to depend on Vibha anymore—but whenever he imagined he had lost her, that strength would leave him, and he would be cast into a shoreless sea—like a dying, drowning man, he would desperately cling to the imagined image of Vibha.

At that moment, a great commotion of "Fire!
Fire!" suddenly erupted outside.
Udayaditya's chest tightened—outside, hundreds of voices rose at once, and suddenly, amid various cries of distress, the sound of a hundred people's rapid footsteps was heard in the air.
Udayaditya understood that a fire had broken out somewhere near the palace.
The clamor continued for a long time—his mind grew extremely restless.
Suddenly, the door to his prison was thrown open.
Someone entered his dark room—he started and asked, "Who is it?"

He replied, "It is I, Sitaram, please come out."

Udayaditya said—"Why?"

Sitaram said—"Yubaraj, the prison is on fire, come out quickly!"
Saying this, he grabbed him and almost carried him out of the prison.

After many days, Udayaditya came to an open space—he suddenly saw a vast expanse of sky above his head, and the air seemed to embrace him, spreading its wide chest.
The barriers before his eyes were gone.
In that dark night, under the gaze of the countless stars in the sky, standing on the soft web of grass in the wide field, an immense, indescribable joy suddenly arose in his mind.
Remaining silent for a moment in that joy, he then asked Sitaram—"What should I do?
Where should I go?"
He had been confined in a narrow space for a long time, had not walked or moved about—today, having come to this vast field, he asked Sitaram helplessly, "What should I do?
Where should I go?"
Sitaram said—"Come, come with me!"

Meanwhile, the fire was raging.
In the afternoon, some subjects had come to present a petition to the chief officials.
They were sitting together in the palace courtyard—they were the first to raise the alarm about the fire.
Near the prison, there was a long row of huts for the guards to live in—that was where their cots, utensils, clothes, and all their belongings were kept.
Upon hearing news of the fire, every guard who could ran off; those who absolutely couldn't, started wringing their hands in despair.
There were indeed a couple of guards at Udayaditya’s door, but there was no need for a strict watch there.
They guarded it merely because it was custom.
For Udayaditya would sit so quietly in his room that it never seemed he would try to escape, or even had the desire to.
For this reason, the guards at his door had been the first to run away.
Night began to fall, but the fire would not go out.
Some started moving belongings, others started pouring water, and still others did nothing at all, simply wandering about and making a commotion.
After the fire was extinguished, it was they who received more praise than anyone.
While everyone was thus occupied, a woman came running into their midst.
She wanted to say something—but who would listen to her?
Some cursed her, others pushed her away—no one listened to her.
One who did listen said, “The Yubaraj has escaped, so what's it to me, you wench, and what's it to you?
Dayal Singh knows about it—I can’t leave my own house now.”
Saying this, he vanished into the crowd.
Being rebuffed like this again and again, the woman became utterly furious.
She forcefully grabbed the first person she found and said, “You wretch, are you blind?
Have you no sense that you are in the king’s service?
Tomorrow, I will tell the king and have you buried in the ground with thorns below and thorns above!
The Yubaraj has escaped!”
“Good for him—what's it to you?”
he said, and gave her a sound beating.
This man was one of those who had set the fire.
After being beaten, the woman’s appearance became terrifying.
Her eyes blazed like an angry tigress’s, her hair fanned out, and she ground her teeth.
The glow of the flames falling on her face made it look like that of a demoness.
A piece of wood was burning in front of her; she picked it up.
Her hand was burned, but she did not drop it.
Taking the burning log, she ran after him.
Unable to catch him, she threw the piece of wood at him.

## Chapter 30

Sitaram took the Yubaraj with him to the bank of the canal; a large boat was tied there, and they both went and stood before it.
Seeing them, a person hurried out from the boat and said, “Dada, you have come?”
Udayaditya was completely startled—that eternally familiar voice, a voice intertwined with the memories of his childhood, with the joys and sorrows of his youth—a voice inseparable from whatever happiness, whatever joy exists in the world!
The very same voice he would sometimes hear like a flute's melody in a dream while sitting sleeplessly in his cell deep in the night, and be startled!
That voice!
Before his astonishment could break, Basanta Ray came and embraced him.
The eyes of both filled with tears.
They both sat down on the grass right there.
After a long time, Udayaditya said, “Dada Mahashay!”
Basanta Ray said, “What, Dada!”
No more words were spoken.
Again, after a long while, Udayaditya looked all around, looked at the sky, looked at Basanta Ray's face and said in a desolate voice, “Dada Mahashay, today I have found freedom—I have found you, what other happiness is left for me?
How long will this moment last?”
A little while later, Sitaram, with folded hands, said, “Yubaraj, please get on the boat.”

The Yubaraj, snapping out of his daze, said, “Why, why the boat?”

Sitaram said, “Otherwise the guards will be here again shortly.”

Astonished, Udayaditya asked Basanta Ray, “Dada Mahashay, are we running away?”

Basanta Ray, holding Udayaditya's hand, said, “Yes, brother, I am stealing you away!
This is a land of stone hearts—they do not love you!
You are a fawn living in a hunter's kingdom—I will hide you within my heart, you will be safe there!”
Saying this, he pulled Udayaditya close to his chest—as if he wanted to snatch him from the harsh world and keep him confined in a kingdom of affection.

After thinking for a long time, Udayaditya said, “No, Dada Mahashay, I cannot run away.”

Basanta Ray said, “Why, Dada, have you forgotten this old man?”

Udayaditya said, “I will go—I will go and fall at my father's feet, cry and beg him, perhaps he will consent to let me go to Raigarh.”

Basanta Ray, getting up agitatedly, said, “Dada, listen to me—don't go there, that effort is futile.”

Udayaditya sighed and said, “Then I will go—I will return to the prison.”

Basanta Ray gripped his hand and said, “Let's see you try.
I will not let you go.”

Udayaditya said, “Dada Mahashay, why do you invite danger for the sake of this unfortunate one?
Is there a possibility of even a moment's peace wherever I am?”

Basanta Ray said, “Dada, because of you, Vibha has also become a prisoner.
In this youth of hers, will she sacrifice all the happiness of her life?”
Tears started falling from Basanta Ray's eyes.

Then Udayaditya quickly said, “Then let's go, let's go, Dada Mahashay.”
Looking at Sitaram, he said, “Sitaram, I want to send three letters to the palace.”

Sitaram said, “There is paper and pen on the boat, I'll bring them.
Please write quickly, there isn't much time.”

Udayaditya begged his father's forgiveness.
To his mother he wrote, “Ma, you were never able to be happy for having carried me in your womb.
Be at ease now, Ma—I am going to Dada Mahashay's place.
I will be happy there, I will be in affection, there will be no cause for you to worry.”
To Vibha he wrote, “Chirayushmatiyu—what more can I write to you—may you be happy for life after life—go to your husband's home, establish a happy household and forget all your sorrow and suffering!”
As he wrote, Udayaditya's eyes filled with tears.
Sitaram sent those three letters to the palace with one of the oarsmen.
As everyone was boarding the boat, they saw someone running towards them.
Sitaram, startled, cried out, “Oh no—that sorceress is coming!”
In no time, Rukmini reached them.
Her hair was disheveled, the end of her sari had fallen, her two eyes, like burning embers, were spewing fire.
Impatient with the agony of her repeatedly thwarted desires and unsatisfied thirst for revenge, she seemed to want to tear to pieces whomever she found before her to quench her rage!
Where the guards were putting out the fire, she had been repeatedly pushed back and, wild with anger, had entered the palace like a madwoman—she had repeatedly tried in vain to enter Pratapaditya's room directly; the guards, thinking her mad, beat her and drove her away.
Restless with torment, she came running from the palace.
Like a tigress, she tried to leap upon Udayaditya.
Sitaram came in between—screaming, she pounced on Sitaram, holding him with all her might in her two arms.
Suddenly Sitaram cried out.
The boatmen and oarsmen hurried over and forcefully separated Rukmini from him.
Like a suicidal scorpion that stings its own body, she, becoming frantic, clawed at her own chest, tore her hair, and screamed, “Nothing came of it, nothing came of it—I am dying now, the sin of killing a woman will be yours.”
On that dark night, this curse echoed in all directions.
In an instant, with the speed of lightning, Rukmini jumped into the water.
The canal water was very high due to the monsoon—there was no telling where she sank.
Blood was falling from Sitaram's shoulder; he soaked his shawl in water and tied it around the wound.
Going near, he saw that beads of sweat had appeared on Udayaditya's forehead, his hands and feet had gone cold, and he had almost fainted—Basanta Ray also seemed bewildered and dumbfounded.
The oarsmen took hold of both of them, lifted them into the boat, and immediately cast off.
Sitaram said fearfully, “What an ill omen at the start of our journey!”

## Chapter 31

Udayaditya's boat crossed the canal and reached the river.
Then, Sitaram disembarked from the boat and returned to the city.
As he was leaving, he asked for and took the Yubaraj’s sword.

Sitaram had indeed sent three of Udayaditya's letters to the palace with a man, but he had secretly and strictly forbidden him from giving the letters to anyone.
Returning to the palace from the boat, Sitaram took those letters back.
He kept only the letters for the Mahishi and Vibha and destroyed the remaining one.

By then, the fire had spread even further.
Many people had gotten out of their beds at night to watch the spectacle.
This was hindering the firefighting efforts rather than helping.

It goes without saying that Sitaram had a hand in this blaze.
He had accomplished this feat with the help of a few commoners loyal to Udayaditya and some palace servants.
The fact that five or six rooms had caught fire simultaneously in the evening for no reason was no act of fate; there was also a reason why the fire was not being extinguished despite so much effort.
Among those who had joined the effort to put out the fire, one or two were Sitaram's men.
They poured water where there was no fire, went to fetch water but did not bring it back, skillfully broke their water pots, and created confusion by stumbling into one another.
The fire would not go out.

Meanwhile, as this chaos was unfolding, Sitaram's men set fire to Udayaditya's empty prison cell.
One by one, they set the windows, doors, beams, rafters, doorframes, and wooden fences ablaze.
It was beyond anyone's wildest dreams that a fire could start in that prison cell by any means, so no one had paid any attention to it.
When Sitaram returned, he saw that the fire had taken hold quite well.
Sitaram somehow threw some bones, a skull, and Udayaditya's sword into that room.

Meanwhile, those who were extinguishing the fire in the guardhouse suddenly heard a shout from the direction of the prison.
Startled, they all cried out in unison, “What was that!”
A man came running and said, “Hey, the Yubaraj's cell has caught fire!”
The guards' blood turned to water; Dayal Singh's head began to spin.
Water pots fell from their hands; they dropped their tools on the ground.
Just then, another man came running from that direction and said, “The Yubaraj was heard screaming from inside the prison!”
Before he could finish his sentence, Sitaram came running and cried, “Hey, you all, come quickly!
The roof of the Yubaraj's cell has collapsed, and there's no response from him anymore.”
Everyone ran towards the Yubaraj's prison cell.
Arriving, they saw the building had collapsed—there was fire everywhere—there was no way to enter the room.
Standing there, they began to blame one another.
Everyone set about determining whose carelessness had caused this incident.
A fierce argument broke out; they began to curse each other, and it even seemed a fight was about to erupt.

Sitaram thought, 'I can spread the news that the Yubaraj has died in the fire and remain untroubled for some time.'
When he saw that the room was burning well, he wrapped his shawl around his head and set off happily towards his cottage; he came a long way from the palace.
It was late at night, there were no people on the path, all was quiet around—a southern breeze blew intermittently, rustling the bamboo leaves.
Sitaram's stylish soul was elated; he began to sing a song full of sentiment.
The lone traveler walked along that deserted, silent path, singing in the joy of his heart.
After going some distance, a thought occurred to him.
He thought, 'I'll have to flee Jessore with my family anyway, so why not secure some money without any effort?
That wretched Mangala is dead—good riddance—let me just stop by her house.
The bitch has a lot of money—she has no one in her three worlds—if I don't take the money, someone else will.
So what's the harm, let me give it a try!'
Thinking this and that, Sitaram headed towards Rukmini's house—his cheerful heart began to sing again.
On the way, he saw a woman on a tryst.
Nothing like this ever escaped Sitaram's notice.
An irresistible urge to make a couple of witty remarks arose in his mind—but seeing he had no time, he suppressed the urge and walked on briskly.

Reaching Rukmini's cottage, Sitaram saw that the door was open.
He entered the cottage with a cheerful heart and glanced around.
It was pitch dark; nothing could be seen.
He fumbled around for a moment.
He tripped over a chest and fell, and bumped his head against the wall a couple of times.
A creepy feeling came over Sitaram.
It felt as if someone was in the room.
It seemed he could hear someone's breathing—he slowly went into the side room.
There he saw that light was coming from Rukmini's bedroom.
Sitaram was overjoyed, thinking the lamp was still burning.
He hurried towards that room.
Who was that!
Who was sitting in the room!
A woman sat silently with sleepless eyes, trembling violently.
A wet cloth was wrapped around her half-covered body; water was dripping, drop by drop, from her disheveled hair.
Her teeth were chattering as she shivered.
Only a single lamp was burning in the room.
The faint light of that lamp fell on her ashen face—behind her, a very large shadow of the woman fell on the wall.
There was nothing else in the room—only that ashen face—that long shadow and a terrifying silence!
Upon entering the room, Sitaram's body went cold.
He saw that it was Mangala, sitting there in the faint light, with disheveled hair and wet clothes.
Seeing her so suddenly, he thought she was a ghost.
Sitaram did not dare to move forward—nor could he gather the courage to turn back!
Sitaram was not exactly a coward; after standing still for a short while, he finally said in a tone of feigned courage and verbal mockery, “Where did you come from!
Wench, are you immortal or what!”
Rukmini stared fixedly at Sitaram's face for a while—at that moment, Sitaram's heart rose to his throat and began to pound.
Finally, Rukmini suddenly exclaimed, “Indeed!
You all are not ruined yet; and I am to die!”
She stood up and, waving her hand, said, “I have returned from the door of Yama!
First, I will lay you and the Yubaraj in the oven, and only after I have smeared my body with two handfuls of ash from your pyres to consecrate my body—will I satisfy Yama's desire—before that, there is no place for me in Yamalaya.”

Hearing Rukmini's voice gave Sitaram great courage.
He suddenly tried to feign great affection and make up with Rukmini.
He did not get very close, but coming relatively near, he said in a soft voice, “Honestly, my dear, this is what makes me angry!
I can't quite understand what mood you'll be in and when!
Tell me, Mangala, what have I done to you!
Why are you so displeased with your humble servant?
Are you sulking, my dear?
Shall I sing that song?”

The more Sitaram feigned affection, the more enraged Rukmini became—her entire body, from head to foot, burned with rage.
If Sitaram had been her own hair, she would have torn it out with both hands; if Sitaram had been her own eye, she would have instantly gouged it out with her nails and trampled it underfoot.
She looked around but found nothing within reach!
Clenching her teeth, she said, “Just you wait; I'm going to make you pay,” and trembling violently, she went into the next room in search of a curved blade.
Just a little while ago, Sitaram, with a shawl around his neck, had made a metaphorical proposal to die, but seeing Rukmini's appearance, his metaphor twisted, and he realized that he was not yet ready to die from the blow of a real blade—for this reason, seizing the opportunity, he immediately slipped out of the cottage.
Rukmini, blade in hand, came into the empty room and repeatedly struck the floor where Sitaram had stood.

Rukmini had now become reckless.
The Yubaraj's behavior had shattered her desperate hope—all her means, all her objectives, had been razed to the ground.
Now Rukmini no longer had that sharp, honed smile, nor that electrifying side-glance; her surging, overflowing waves like the river Jahnavi in the month of Bhadra were gone.
The palace servants who used to come to her, she had fought with them, cursed them, and driven them away.
The Dewanji's eldest son had come the other day, chewing paan, to jest with her; Rukmini had chased him away with a broom.
Now no one could get near her.
Everyone in the neighborhood was afraid of her.

Coming out of the cottage, Sitaram thought, 'Mangala knows everything about the Yubaraj's escape.
Therefore, everything will be exposed through her—why didn't I just strangle the wretch to death!
In any case, it is not wise for me to stay in Jessore for another moment.
I'll flee right now.'
That very night, Sitaram fled Jessore with his family to Raigarh.

In the last watch of the night, clouds gathered and it began to rain in torrents—the fire also gradually went out.
The rumor of the Yubaraj's death reached Pratapaditya's ears.

Upon hearing it, Pratapaditya immediately came out to his assembly hall and took his seat.
The guards were summoned, the minister arrived, and one or two other courtiers came.
One witness testified that when the fire was burning fiercely, he had seen the Yubaraj through the window.
A few others said they had heard the Yubaraj's screams.
And another brought forth the melted, burnt remains of his sword from the Yubaraj's cell.

Pratapaditya asked, “Where is my uncle?”
They searched the palace but could not find him.
Someone said, “When the fire broke out, he was also in the prison.”
Someone else said, “No, he had received the news during the night that the Yubaraj had died in the fire, and upon hearing that, he immediately left Jessore.”

As Pratapaditya was thus sitting in court listening to everyone's testimony, a clamor arose at the doorway.
A woman wanted to enter the room, but the guards were stopping her.
Hearing this, Pratapaditya ordered her to be brought in.
A guard brought Rukmini in.
The king asked her, “What do you want?”
Waving her hand, she said loudly, “I want nothing else—I want to see your guards, all of them, one by one, rot in a dungeon for six months and then be fed to the Dalkutta.
Do they obey you, or do they fear you!”
Hearing this, the guards started clamoring from all sides.
Rukmini turned around, her eyes blazing, and gave them a sharp rebuke, “Quiet, you wretches!
Yesterday when I was begging you, pleading with my hands and feet, telling you repeatedly—‘Oh, your Yubaraj is escaping with your old king of Raigarh’—why didn't you wretched fools listen to my words then?
You serve in the king's palace, you have become very arrogant, you've seen the snake's fifth leg!
Ants grow wings only to die!”

Pratapaditya said, “Tell me everything that happened.”

Rukmini said, “What is there to tell!
Your Yubaraj escaped last night with the old king.”

Pratapaditya asked, “Do you know who set the fire?”

Rukmini said, “Who else would I know!
It was that Sitaram of yours.
He is so friendly with your Yubaraj—as if no one else is anyone to him, as if Sitaram is his everything.
All of this is the work of that Sitaram.
The old king, Sitaram, and your Yubaraj, these three conspired and did this—I am telling you this plainly!”

Pratapaditya remained silent for a long time!
He asked, “How did you come to know all this?”

Rukmini said, “What does it matter!
Give me men, and I will go myself and find them.
Your palace servants are all sheep—they won't do this job.”

Pratapaditya ordered men to be sent with Rukmini and decreed appropriate punishment for the guards.
One by one, the assembly hall emptied.
Only the minister and the Maharaja remained.
The minister thought that the Maharaja would surely say something to him.
But Pratapaditya said nothing; he remained sitting in silence.
The minister, with the intention of saying something, said in a very soft voice, “Maharaj!”
The Maharaja gave him no answer.
The minister slowly got up and left.

Before evening that very day, Pratapaditya received news of Udayaditya's escape from a fisherman.
He had seen Udayaditya traveling by boat down the river.
Gradually, he began to receive news from various other people.
The men who had gone with Rukmini returned after a week and said, “We saw the Yubaraj in Raigarh.”
The king asked, “Where is that woman?”
They replied, “She did not return; she remained there.”

Then Pratapaditya summoned one of his Pathan commanders named Muktiyar Khan and gave him a secret order.
The commander saluted and left.

## Chapter 32

Before Pratapaditya, the Mahishi and Vibha had learned the news of Udayaditya's escape.
Both were overwhelmed with fear, wondering what the Maharaj might do when he found out.
Each day, as the Maharaj received one piece of news after another, their hearts grew more agitated with apprehension.
A week passed like this, and finally, the Maharaj received credible, true news.
But he did nothing.
He showed not even a hint of anger.
Unable to remain in suspense any longer, the Mahishi went to Pratapaditya.
But for a long time, she did not dare to ask any questions about Udayaditya.
The Maharaj also did not raise the subject.
Finally, unable to bear it, the Mahishi cried out, “Maharaj, grant me one request, forgive Udayaditya this time!
If you cause my child any more suffering, I will take poison and die!”

Pratapaditya said with slight annoyance, “Why have you started crying already?
I haven't done anything!”

Lest Pratapaditya should suddenly become obstinate again, the Mahishi did not dare to raise the matter a second time.
With a frightened heart, she slowly walked away.
One day, two days, three days passed, and no change in the Maharaj's disposition was observed.
Seeing this, the Mahishi and Vibha were reassured.
They thought that perhaps the Maharaj was secretly pleased that Udayaditya had gone elsewhere.

For a few days now, the Mahishi was able to be somewhat at ease.

Before this, the Mahishi had told Vibha and announced throughout the household that Ramchandra Ray had written a letter requesting that Vibha be sent to her in-laws' house.
Vibha's heart could no longer contain its joy.
Ever since she had sent Rammohan away, Vibha had not had a moment's peace of mind.
Whenever she had a free moment, she would think, “What must he be thinking?
Has he understood my situation correctly?
Perhaps he is angry!
If I explained it to him, would he not forgive me?
Oh Jagadishwar, when will I get to explain?
When will we meet again?”
Vibha would constantly turn these thoughts over and over in her mind.
A constant apprehension had weighed upon her heart day and night.
Hearing her mother's words, what immense joy Vibha felt, what a terrible, heavy burden was instantly lifted from her mind.
Casting aside all shyness and shame, laughing and crying, she hid her face in her mother's breast and remained silent for a long time.
Her mother began to cry.
When Vibha thought that her husband had not misunderstood her, that he had understood what was in her heart—in her eyes, the whole world became Nandan Kanan.
How magnanimous her husband's heart seemed to her!
How much faith, how much trust was born in her for her husband's love!
She felt that her husband's love was her unshakeable refuge in this world.
She felt that she was like a small, delicate creeper, wrapping her arms around the broad shoulders of a strong, great man, relying on him fearlessly with infinite faith, and that she would never be separated from that support.
Vibha became cheerful.
Her spirit became as expansive and clear as an autumn sky free of clouds.
Now she plays all sorts of childish games with her brother Samaraditya.
Like a small, affectionate girl, she makes all sorts of requests to her mother and helps with the housework.
Her previous disposition, like a wordless, silent, melancholy shadow, had vanished—now her cheerful heart blossomed throughout her being like the bright morning.
That old reserve, that shyness, that sadness, that pride, that silent manner was no more.
She now spoke so many things to her mother with joy and trust that she would have been too shy to say before, and wouldn't even have wished to.
Seeing her daughter's joy, the mother's boundless affection welled up.
A worry was indeed stirring deep within her mind—but she never revealed even a hint of that worry to Vibha.
As a mother, how could she bear to dim even a speck of Vibha's pure, serene smile!
For this reason, as the girl laughed and played before her eyes each day, the mother watched with a smiling face and insatiable eyes.

Because there was a fear, a doubt present in the Mahishi's mind, she kept putting it off, so far unable to bring herself to send Vibha to her in-laws' house.
Two weeks passed, and everyone had become somewhat reassured about Udayaditya's situation.
Only, the Mahishi still could not decide what to do about Vibha.
A few more days passed like this.
The longer the delay, the more Vibha's impatience grew.
Vibha thought that the more she delayed, the more she was becoming an offender in her husband's eyes.
When he has sent for me, what is the reason for this delay!
He forgave me once, but again—. For a few days, Vibha said nothing more.
Finally, one day, she could bear it no longer; she went to her mother, put her arms around her neck, looked into her face, and said, “Ma.”
With that one word, her mother understood everything.
Pulling Vibha to her chest, she said, “What is it, my child?”
Vibha remained silent for a moment and finally said, “Ma, when will you send me, Ma!”
As she spoke, her face and ears turned red.
The mother, smiling slightly, asked, “Where shall I send you, Vibhu!”
Vibha said in a pleading tone, “Please tell me, Ma.”
The Mahishi said, “Wait a little longer, my child.
I will send you soon.”
As she spoke, tears came to her eyes.

## Chapter 33

After a long time, Udayaditya came to Raigarh, but he did not feel the same joy as before.
A worry weighed on his mind, so nothing felt quite right.
He was thinking, there was no telling what would become of his grand-uncle for what he had done; it did not seem likely that his father would grant him an easy reprieve.
In what an unlucky moment I must have been born!
He went to Basanta Ray and said, “Grand-uncle, I must leave.
I must return to Jessore.”

At first, Basanta Ray laughed and sang to brush the matter aside.
He sang—

Am I ever going to let you go!

I may not have won your heart with my own,

But I will hold you here by force.

If you have stolen my soul, leaving my heart's palace empty,

Then you yourself must stay there

And fill my empty heart.

Finally, when Udayaditya repeated his wish again and again, Basanta Ray was hurt.
He stopped his song and said with a sad face, “Why, Dada?
What troubles you when I am near?”
Udayaditya could not say anything more.

Seeing Udayaditya so distracted, Basanta Ray tried with all his might, day and night, to make him happy.
He would play the sitar and wander about with him—his royal duties all but ceased for Udayaditya's sake.
Basanta Ray feared that he would not be able to keep Udayaditya, that Udayaditya would go back to Jessore again.
He kept a constant eye on him day and night, telling him, “Dada, I will not let you go back to that land of the stone-hearted.”

After staying for some days, the anxiety in Udayaditya's mind began to loosen its grip.
Having gained freedom after a long time, released from the four narrow, stone prison walls, he was now living within Basanta Ray's tender heart, within his boundless affection.
After a long time, he was seeing trees and plants, seeing the sky, seeing the open light of dawn spreading in all directions, hearing the birds sing, feeling the wind from the distant horizon rush against his whole body.
At night, he could see the sky full of stars and would be immersed in the flow of moonlight, dwelling in the very soul of the sleeping stillness.
He could go wherever he wished, do whatever he wished; there were no more barriers.
The subjects who had known Udayaditya as a boy came from far and wide to see him.
Gangadhar came, Fatik came, Habibchacha and Karim Ullah came, Mathur came with his three sons, the two brothers Paran and Hari came, and Shital Sardar came with five stick-fighters to put on a show.
Every day, the subjects came to the Yubaraj.
The Yubaraj asked them all sorts of questions.
The subjects were extremely happy and surprised to see that Udayaditya had still not forgotten them.
Mathur said, “Maharaj, this son of mine was born in the same month you came to Raigarh.
You saw him then, and since then, by your blessing, I have had two more children.”
Saying this, he brought his three sons before the Yubaraj and said, “Offer your respects.”
They prostrated themselves on the ground.
Paran came forward and said, “I was the boatman on the boat Your Highness took from here to Jessore, Maharaj!”
Shital Sardar came and said, “Maharaj, when you were in Raigarh, you watched my stick-fighting and gave me a reward.
Today, I wish to show my sons’ skills to the Maharaj.
Come on, my boys, step forward.”
So saying, he called to his sons.
In this way, every morning, subjects would come in groups to Udayaditya and they would all talk together.

Amidst such affection, amidst nature, joy, and outpourings of song, the anxiety in Udayaditya's mind naturally began to fade.
He closed his eyes and thought that perhaps his father was not angry, that perhaps he was even pleased—otherwise, what could he have done in all this time?
Nothing!

But he could not deceive his mind with such blind faith for long.
A certain fear for his grand-uncle began to grow in his mind.
It was useless to speak to his grand-uncle about returning to Jessore; he decided that one day he would secretly escape to Jessore.
Again, the prison came to mind.
What a world of difference between this joyous freedom and the monotonous life of that cramped, tiny prison!
He recalled every moment in that prison as if it were a year.
He could clearly visualize in his imagination that dark, solitary, airless, confined room, and his body shuddered.
Still, he resolved that one day he must escape from here, back towards that prison.
He could not bring himself to think, 'I will escape today.'
Thinking, 'I will escape one day,' he felt a great sense of relief.

Today is Thursday, an inauspicious time; no journey can be made today, it will have to be tomorrow.
The day is very bad.
It has been drizzling continuously since morning.
The entire sky is plastered with clouds.
Udayaditya has decided that he must leave Raigarh this very evening.
In the morning, when he met with Basanta Ray, Basanta Ray embraced him and said, “Dada, last night I had a terrible nightmare.
I can't remember the dream well, only that you and I were—as if—parting for life.”

Taking Basanta Ray's hand
, Udayaditya said, “No, Dada Mashay!—
Even if we do part, why would it be for life?”

Basanta Ray, looking away thoughtfully, said, “What else could it be!
Tell me, how much longer will I live?
I have grown old!”

The final note of last night's nightmare was still echoing in the caverns of Basanta Ray's mind, and so he was lost in thought, distracted.

After remaining quiet for a while, Udayaditya said— “Dada Mashay, what will happen if we are parted again!”

Basanta Ray put his arm around Udayaditya's neck and said, “Why, bhai, why would we be parted?
Don't you leave me.
Don't abandon this old man and run away in my old age, bhai!”

Tears came to Udayaditya's eyes.
He was astonished;—it was as if Basanta Ray had somehow sensed his secret intention.
Sighing, he said, “But my staying near you will only bring you danger, Dada Mashay!”

Basanta Ray laughed and said— “What danger, bhai?
At this age, do I fear danger anymore!
There is no greater danger than death!
And death is my neighbor; he sends for news of me daily, I am not afraid of him.
For a person who has overcome all of life's dangers to survive into old age, what does it matter if his boat sinks upon reaching the shore?”

Udayaditya stayed with Basanta Ray the entire day.
The drizzle continued all day long.

In the afternoon, the rain stopped, and Udayaditya got up.
Basanta Ray said— “Dada, where are you going!”

Udayaditya said— “Just going for a short walk!”

Basanta Ray said— “Perhaps you shouldn't go today.”

Udayaditya said— “Why, Dada Mashay?”

Basanta Ray embraced Udayaditya and said, “Don't you go out of the house today, you stay with me today, bhai!”

Udayaditya said, “I won't go far, Dada Mashay, I will be back soon.”
And with that, he went out.

As he reached the outer gate of the palace, a guard said, “Maharaj, shall I go with you?”

The Yubaraj said— “No, that's not necessary.”

The guard said— “Maharaj has no weapon in his hand!”

The Yubaraj said— “What is the need for a weapon?”

Udayaditya went outside the palace.
There was a long, wide field, and he found himself in the middle of it.
He began to walk alone.
Gradually, the daylight began to fade.
So many thoughts rose in his mind.
The Yubaraj contemplated his aimless, purposeless life.
He reflected that nothing was certain for him, no stability anywhere—there was no telling what the very next moment would bring.
He was young, with much of his life still ahead—how was he to pass this vast, sprawling future without building a home, without finding a permanent shelter anywhere?
Then he remembered—Vibha.
Where was Vibha now?
For so long, he had been the one to block the sun of her happiness—was she happy now?
He silently blessed Vibha many times.

In the middle of the field was a grove of pipal, banyan, date palm, and areca nut trees, where the cowherds would sit in the sun—the Yubaraj entered it.
By then, evening had fallen.
It was dark.
The Yubaraj was supposed to flee that day—he was turning that resolution over in his mind.
When Basanta Ray heard that Udayaditya had fled, what would his condition be—how, his heart struck by the blow, would he say with a sorrowful face, “What?
Dada has run away from me!”
He could see that image clearly.—

Just then, a woman cried out in a harsh voice, “Here!
Here is your Yubaraj—right here!”

Two soldiers carrying torches came and stood before the Yubaraj.
In no time, many more came and surrounded him.
Then the woman approached him and said, “Do you recognize me?
Look this way!
Look this way.”
In the torchlight, the Yubaraj saw it was Rukmini.
Seeing Rukmini's behavior, the soldiers rebuked her, saying, “Be gone, woman!”
Paying them no heed, she continued, “Who did all this?
I did.
Who did all this?
I did.
Who brought all these soldiers here?
I did.
I did so much for your sake, and you—” The Yubaraj turned his back on Rukmini in disgust.
The soldiers forcefully seized Rukmini and pulled her away.
Then Muktiyar Khan came forward, saluted the Yubaraj, and stood before him.
The Yubaraj, astonished, said, “Muktiyar Khan, what is the news?”

Muktiyar Khan said humbly, “Janab, I am here with orders from our Maharaj!”

The Yubaraj asked, “What orders!”

Muktiyar Khan took out the order signed by Pratapaditya and handed it to the Yubaraj.

After reading it, the Yubaraj said, “Why was such a large force needed for this?
I would have gone if you had simply sent me a letter with the order!
I was going to go anyway; I had already decided to.
Then why the delay?
Let's go now.
Let's return to Jessore right now.”
Muktiyar Khan joined his hands and said, “We cannot return right now.”

The Yubaraj asked fearfully, “Why?”
Muktiyar Khan said, “There is another order, and I cannot leave until it is carried out.”

In a frightened voice, the Yubaraj asked, “What order!”

Muktiyar Khan said, “The Maharaja has ordered the death sentence for the King of Raigarh.”

The Yubaraj, startled, cried out loudly, “No, he has not!
That’s a lie!”

Muktiyar Khan said, “Your Highness, it is not a lie.
I have the Maharaj's signed letter with me.”

The Yubaraj grabbed the commander's hand and said eagerly, “Muktiyar Khan, you have misunderstood.
The Maharaj ordered that if you could not find Udayaditya, then Basanta Ray was to be—Since I am surrendering myself, what more is there!
Take me at once, take me now—take me as a prisoner, do not delay any longer!”

Muktiyar Khan said, “Yubaraj, I have not misunderstood.
The Maharaj has given a clear order.”

The Yubaraj, growing frantic, said, “You must have misunderstood.
That is not his intention.
Very well, let's go, let's go to Jessore.
I will explain it to you before the Maharaja.
If he gives the order a second time, then you may carry it out!”

Muktiyar, with folded hands, said, “Yubaraj, forgive me, I cannot do that!”

Growing even more frantic, the Yubaraj said, “Muktiyar, remember, I will ascend the throne one day.
Heed my words, satisfy me!”

Muktiyar stood there, silent.

The Yubaraj's face turned pale, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead.
He gripped the commander's hand tightly and said, “Muktiyar Khan, if you kill that old, innocent, virtuous soul, you will not find a place even in hell!”

Muktiyar Khan said, “There is no sin in obeying the master's orders.”

Udayaditya cried out, “That’s a lie!
Any scripture that says so is a false scripture.
Know this for certain, Muktiyar, there is sin in obeying a sinful order.”

Muktiyar stood there, silent.

Udayaditya looked around and cried out, “Then let me go!
I will return to the fort.
Go there with your soldiers—I challenge you to battle.
After winning on the battlefield, then you may carry out your order!”

Muktiyar stood there, silent.
The soldiers moved in closer, surrounding the Yubaraj.
Seeing no other way, the Yubaraj screamed into the darkness with all his might, “Grand-uncle, beware!”
The forest trembled—the sound faded at the edge of the field.
The soldiers came and seized Udayaditya.
Udayaditya screamed once more, “Grand-uncle, beware!”
A traveler was crossing the field—hearing the sound, he came closer and asked, “Who is it?”
Udayaditya said quickly, “Go, go—run to the fort—warn the king!”
In an instant, the soldiers arrested that traveler.
Anyone who was walking through that field—the soldiers immediately took them captive.

A few soldiers remained to guard the captured Udayaditya.
Muktiyar Khan and the remaining soldiers, shedding their military uniforms and hiding their weapons, headed towards the fort in plain clothes.
Raigarh had over a hundred gates; they entered the fort through different gates.

At that time, in the evening, Basanta Ray was sitting and performing his evening prayers.
Over in the palace's prayer room, the conch and bell for the evening worship were ringing.
There was no clamor in the large palace; all around was silent.
According to Basanta Ray's custom, most of the servants had been given a short leave for the evening.

As he was praying, Basanta Ray suddenly saw Muktiyar Khan enter his room.
In a flurry, he said, “Khan Saheb, do not enter this room.
I will finish my prayers and come right away.”

Muktiyar Khan went outside the room and stood near the doorway.
After completing his prayers, Basanta Ray came out quickly, placed a hand on Muktiyar Khan's arm, and asked, “Khan Saheb, are you well?”

Muktiyar offered a salaam and replied curtly, “Yes, Maharaj!”

Basanta Ray said, “Have you had your meal?”

Muktiyar replied, “Yes, Your Majesty.”

Basanta Ray said, “Then today, let me make arrangements for you to stay here.”

Muktiyar said, “No, Your Majesty, there is no need.
I have a task to finish and must leave immediately!”

Basanta Ray said, “No, that will not do, Khan Saheb.
I will not let you go today; you must stay here today.”

Muktiyar replied, “No, Maharaj, I must leave soon.”

Basanta Ray asked, “Tell me why?
Is there some special task?
Is Pratap well?”

Muktiyar said, “The Maharaja is well.”

Basanta Ray said, “Then what is your task?
Tell me quickly.
Hearing it is so urgent is making me anxious.
No misfortune has befallen Pratap, has it?”

Muktiyar said, “No, Your Majesty, no misfortune has befallen him.
I have come to carry out an order from the Maharaja!”

Basanta Ray asked hurriedly, “What order—tell me now!”

Muktiyar Khan took out an order and handed it to Basanta Ray.
Basanta Ray took it near the light and began to read.
In the meantime, one by one, all the soldiers came and stood surrounding the door.

After he finished reading, Basanta Ray slowly came over to Muktiyar Khan and asked, “Is this Pratap's writing?”

Muktiyar replied, “Yes.”

Basanta Ray asked again, “Khan Saheb, is this written in Pratap's own hand?”

Muktiyar replied, “Yes, Maharaj!”

Then Basanta Ray cried out, “Khan Saheb, I raised Pratap with my own hands!”

He remained silent for a moment, then finally spoke again, “When Pratap was just a little boy, I would carry him in my arms day and night—he wouldn't want to leave my side for even a moment!
That same Pratap grew up, I arranged his marriage, I placed him on the throne—I held his children in my arms—and that same Pratap has written this with his own hand today, Khan Saheb?”

Muktiyar Khan's eyes grew moist; he stood silently with his head bowed.

Basanta Ray asked, “Where is Dada?
Where is Uday?”

Muktiyar Khan said, “He has been captured—he has been sent to the Maharaja for trial.”

Basanta Ray exclaimed, “Uday has been captured?
Captured, Khan Saheb?
Will I not be able to see him one last time?”

Muktiyar Khan, with folded hands, said, “No, Janab, it is not permitted!”

With tearful eyes, Basanta Ray grasped Muktiyar Khan's hand and said, “You will not let me see him just once, Khan Saheb!”

Muktiyar said, “I am merely a servant carrying out an order.”

Basanta Ray let out a deep sigh and said, “There is no mercy or compassion in this world.
Come, Saheb, carry out your order.”

Then Muktiyar touched the ground, offered a salaam, and with folded hands said, “Maharaj, please forgive me—I am only carrying out my master's order, I am not at fault.”

Basanta Ray said, “No, Saheb, what is your fault?
You are not at fault.
What is there for me to forgive?”
Saying this, he went to Muktiyar Khan and embraced him.
He said, “Tell Pratap that I died blessing him.
And listen, Khan Saheb, as I die, I leave the charge of Uday to you.
He is innocent—see to it that he does not suffer further from an unjust trial.”

Saying this, Basanta Ray closed his eyes and prostrated himself before his chosen deity, chanting on his prayer beads with his right hand.
He then said, “Saheb, now!”

Muktiyar Khan called out, “Abdul.”
Abdul came in with a drawn sword.
Muktiyar turned his face away and moved aside.
A moment later, Abdul came out of the room with a bloodied sword—a stream of blood began to flow in the room!

## Chapter 34

Muktiyar Khan returned.
Leaving most of the soldiers in Raigarh, he set out for Jessore at once with Udayaditya.
On the two-day journey, Udayaditya did not touch any food—he did not speak a single word to anyone—he just kept thinking in silence.
He was as still as a stone statue—there was no sleep in his eyes, no blinking, no tears, no sight—he was just thinking.
He boarded the boat—he leaned out from the boat and stared at the water, the boat moved on—he heard the sound of the oars, the gurgling of the water entered his ears, yet he heard nothing, saw nothing, he just kept thinking.
Night fell, stars appeared in the sky, the boatmen tied up the boat, everyone on the boat slept, only the sound of the water could be heard, small waves lapped against the boat—the Yubaraj stared straight ahead—gazing at the vast, white sandbank, he just kept thinking.
At dawn the boatmen awoke—they untied the boat—the morning breeze blew—the east turned red, the Yubaraj kept thinking.
On the third day, a flood of tears streamed from the Yubaraj's eyes—resting his head on his hands, he stared at the water—he stared at the sky.
The boat moved on—the trees and plants on the bank passed before his eyes like clouds, tears fell from his eyes in a thousand streams.
After a long time, seeing an opportunity, Muktiyar Khan, with a pained heart, came and sat near the Yubaraj.
He asked humbly, “Yubaraj, what are you thinking?”
The Yubaraj was startled—for a long time, he stared at Muktiyar's face in silent amazement.
Seeing the look of compassion on Muktiyar's face, the Yubaraj's suppressed spirit suddenly broke free, and he cried out—“I am thinking, what have I accomplished by being born into this world?
What utter ruin has been caused because of me!
O Vidhata, why are the weak born into this world?
Those who cannot stand in the world on their own strength—who cling to others at every step—what good do they do for the world?
Whomever they hold onto, they sink; they obstruct every worldly affair—they cannot stand themselves, and they burden everyone else.—I am a weak coward, yet Ishwar saved me, and those who were the joy of the world, the hope of the world—they were destroyed for my sake?
No more, I am taking my leave of this world.”

Udayaditya was brought before Pratapaditya as a prisoner.
Pratapaditya took him to a room in the inner quarters and bolted the door.
As soon as he came near Pratapaditya, Udayaditya's body seemed to shudder, his entire flesh seemed to cringe with an unbearable revulsion—he could no longer look at his father's face!

Pratapaditya said in a grave voice, “What punishment is fitting for you?”

Udayaditya replied, unwavering, “Whatever you command.”

Pratapaditya said, “You are not worthy of this kingdom of mine.”

Udayaditya said, “No, Maharaj, I am not worthy.
I do not want your kingdom—grant me release from your throne—this is my plea.”

Pratapaditya wanted the same.
He said, “How am I to know that what you are saying is truly the feeling of your heart?”

Udayaditya said, “I may have been born with weakness, but to this day I have never told a lie for my own gain.
If you believe me, today I will touch the feet of Ma-Kali and swear an oath—I will never rule even a needle's tip worth of your land—Samaraditya will be the heir to your kingdom.”

Satisfied, Pratapaditya said, “Then what do you want?”

Udayaditya said, “Maharaj, I want nothing else—only do not lock me up in a cell like a caged beast!
Abandon me, I will leave for Kashi right now.
One more plea—give me some money—I will establish a guest house and a temple there in my grand-uncle's name.”

Pratapaditya said, “Very well, I agree to that.”

That very day, Udayaditya went to the temple and, in front of Pratapaditya, took his oath, saying, “Ma-Kali, you be my witness, touching your feet I swear this oath—as long as I live, I will not accept even an iota of the kingdom of the Maharaja of Jessore as my own—I will not sit on the throne of Jessore, I will not even touch the royal scepter of Jessore.
If I ever do, then may all the sin of my grand-uncle's murder be mine!”
Saying this, he shuddered.

When the Maharani heard that Udayaditya was leaving for Kashi, she came to Udayaditya and said, “Baba Uday, take me with you as well.”

Udayaditya said, “What are you saying, Ma!
You have Samaraditya, your whole world remains here.
If you leave, the Rajya-Lakshmi of Jessore will not remain.”

The Mahishi wept and said, “My child, if you leave the world at this age, with what heart can I remain with the world?
You will live as an ascetic, having renounced kingdom and family—who will look after you there?
Your father may be stone, but I cannot let you go!”
Among all her children, the Mahishi loved Udayaditya the most; she began to cry her heart out for Udayaditya.

Udayaditya held his mother's hand and said with tearful eyes, “Ma, you know that if I stay in the palace, there will be cause for fear at every step—be at ease, Ma, I will be safe at the feet of Vishveshvar.”

Udayaditya went to Vibha and said, “Vibha, my dear sister, I will see you happy before I go to Kashi.
I will personally take you to your husband's home, this is my only remaining wish!”

Vibha asked Udayaditya, “Dada, how is Dadamahashay?”

“Dadamahashay is well.”
Saying this, Udayaditya quickly left the room.

## Chapter 35

Preparations began for Udayaditya and Vibha's journey.
Vibha clung to her mother's neck and cried.
Before she left for her in-laws' house, everyone present in the inner quarters began to offer Vibha all sorts of good advice.

The Mahishi summoned Udayaditya once and said, “Baba, you are taking Vibha away.
What if they neglect her!”

Startled, Udayaditya replied, “Why, Ma?
Why would they neglect her?”

The Mahishi said, “Who knows, what if they are angry with Vibha!”

Udayaditya said, “No, Ma, Vibha is just a child.
How could they ever be angry with her?”

The Mahishi said tearfully, “My child, take her carefully.
If they disrespect her, Vibha will not survive!”

A sense of dread awakened in Udayaditya’s mind.
The thought that Vibha could be disrespected at her in-laws’ house had never occurred to him before.
Udayaditya had thought that the consequences of his actions had all been exhausted—but now he saw they were not yet over.
He had taken Vibha under his wing; who knew what her fate held as a result!

At the time of departure, Udayaditya and Vibha came and bowed to their mother.
Fearing it would be an ill omen for the journey, the Mahishi did not cry then; as soon as they left, she fell to the ground and began to weep.
Udayaditya and Vibha came and bowed to their father, and they bowed to the other elders of the household.
Udayaditya lifted Samaraditya into his lap, kissed him, and said to himself, “My dear boy, may the curse of the throne you will sit upon never touch you!”
The servants of the palace, who loved Udayaditya dearly, came one by one and bowed to him; all of them wept.
Finally, they both went to the temple, bowed to the deity, and set off.

The stage of sorrow, danger, and tyranny was left behind—the prison of a lifetime was left behind.
Udayaditya thought to himself, I will never enter this house again in this life.
He glanced back once.
He saw the bloodthirsty, hard-hearted palace raising its head into the sky, standing like a demon.
Left behind were conspiracy, tyranny, bloodlust, the oppression of the weak, and the tears of the helpless.
Before him, infinite freedom, the untarnished beauty of nature, and the heart’s natural affection and tenderness stretched out two hands to embrace him.
It was just dawn.
On the eastern bank of the river, a spray of light rose in tall flames from within the forest’s edge; a golden glow fell upon the treetops.
People had awoken; boatmen, singing joyfully, had hoisted their sails and untied their boats.
Seeing this pure, serene, and sacred face of the morning, Udayaditya’s soul sang a song of freedom along with the birds.
He thought to himself, “For birth after birth, may I be able to roam freely amidst this pure, green spirit of nature, and live together with simple souls.”

The boat set off.
Listening to the boatmen’s song and the murmur of the water, the two moved forward.
The dawn light of joy bloomed in Vibha’s serene heart; her face and eyes held the glow of sunrise.
It was as if, after all these days, she had awakened from a nightmare and was reassured by the sight of the world.
Vibha was going.
To whom was she going?
Who was calling her?
Infinite, unshakeable love had called her—like a small bird, Vibha would fold her wings and hide trustingly in the comfort of that tender layer of love.
Today, she could see an ocean of affection all around the world.
Udayaditya called Vibha closer and, in a soft voice like the murmur of water, began to tell her all sorts of stories.
Whatever she heard, Vibha liked.

The boat entered the kingdom of Ramchandra Ray.
Looking all around, an unprecedented joy arose in Vibha’s heart.
What beautiful splendor!
Seeing the cottages and the people, Vibha thought how happy everyone must be!
Vibha felt the urge to call the subjects over and ask them about their king.
Seeing the subjects, a strange and wonderful affection arose in her heart.
Whomever she saw, she liked them all.
Occasionally, she saw a poor person or two, and Vibha thought to herself, “Alas, why is this person in such a state?
I will summon them to the inner quarters.
I will do whatever is needed to relieve their sorrow.”
She felt that everything was her own.
She could not bear that sorrow and poverty existed in this kingdom.
Vibha wished that the subjects would come to her, call her ‘Ma’ just once, present their own sorrows to her, and she would take those sorrows away.

Udayaditya moored the boat in a village near the capital.
He had decided that he would send word of their arrival to the palace, and they would come to receive them with a proper welcome.
It was late afternoon when they moored the boat.
Udayaditya thought that a messenger could be sent in the morning—but Vibha's heart wished for the news to be sent that very day.

## Chapter 36

Today the people were very busy.
Music was playing all around.
It seemed as if a festival had come to the village.
An impatient joy was already stirring in Vibha's heart, and upon hearing the sounds of music from all around, her heart seemed to overflow.
Fearing that her excessive joy would be revealed to Udayaditya, she suppressed her smile with great difficulty!
Seeing the festive mood on the riverbank, Udayaditya went for a walk in the village to find out what was happening.

A little while passed.
Someone from the bank asked, “Whose boat is that?”

From the boat, the palace retainers called out.
“Who’s that?
It’s Rammohan!
Hey, come on, come on!”

Rammohan quickly boarded the boat.
Vibha was sitting alone on the boat.
Seeing Rammohan, she exclaimed, overflowing with joy, “Mohan.”

Rammohan said, “Ma.”

After looking for a long while at Vibha's face, so full of simple joy and ready to smile, Rammohan said with a crestfallen expression, “Ma, you’ve come today?”

Vibha said quickly, “Yes, Mohan.
Has the Maharaj received the news already?
Have you come to take me?”

Rammohan said, “No, Ma, don’t be in such a hurry—let it be for today—I will take you another day.”

Seeing Rammohan's expression, Vibha's face fell completely, and she said, “Why, Mohan—why won't I go today!”

Rammohan said, “It’s already evening—let it be for today, Ma.”

Vibha, becoming utterly frightened, said, “Tell me the truth, Mohan, what has happened?”

Rammohan could not hold back any longer.
It was not in his nature to hide the truth!
He sat down right there and, weeping, said, “Revered Mother, today in your own kingdom there is no place for you—in your own royal palace, there is no home for you.
Today, the Maharaj is getting married.”

Vibha’s face turned completely pale.
Her hands and feet grew ice-cold!
Rammohan continued, “Mother, when this unworthy son of yours went to summon you, why did you not come then, Mother?
Why did you become a cruel, stone-hearted woman and send me back?
I was left with no face before the Maharaj!
My heart was breaking, yet I could not speak a single word on your behalf!”

Vibha could no longer see anything—her head spun, and she fell right there.
Rammohan quickly brought water and sprinkled it on her face and eyes.
A short while later, Vibha sat up.
With a single blow, her entire world had shattered.
Having entered her husband’s kingdom, reached the capital, and arrived at the very gates of the royal palace, all the hopes of happiness for the thirst-hearted Vibha vanished like a mirage.

Vibha asked in anguish, “Mohan, but he sent for me—am I very late in coming?”

Mohan replied, “You are late indeed.”

Vibha said desperately, “Will he not forgive me anymore?”

Mohan replied, “But he offered no forgiveness.”

Vibha said, “Mohan, I will go just to see him once.”
Saying this, she broke down, sobbing breathlessly.

Wiping his eyes, Rammohan said, “Let it be for today, Mother.”

Vibha said, “No, Mohan, I will go and see him this very day.”

Rammohan replied, “Let the Yubaraj first return from the village.”

“No, Mohan,” said Vibha, “I will go this instant.”

Vibha had thought that if Udayaditya heard this news, he would forbid her from going for fear of the humiliation.

Rammohan said, “Then I shall have a palanquin brought.”

Vibha said, “A palanquin?
Why?
Am I a queen that I should ask for a palanquin?
I will go like a common subject, like a beggar-woman—what use have I for a palanquin?”

Rammohan said, “As long as I live, I cannot bear to see that.”

Vibha pleaded in a distressed voice, “Mohan, I beg of you, don't stop me any longer—it is getting late!”

With a pained heart, Rammohan said, “Very well, Ma.
So be it.”

Dressed as a common woman, Vibha stepped out from the boat.
The boat's servants came forward and said, “What is this, Ma?
Where are you going dressed like this?”

Rammohan said, “This is the Mother's own kingdom; she may go wherever she wishes!”

The servants started to object, but Rammohan chased them away.

## Chapter 37

There were people all around, a crowd on every side.
Previously, Vibha would have died of shyness, but today it was as if she noticed nothing.
Everything she saw seemed false to her.
It was like being jostled about in a clamorous dream—as if nothing was anything at all.
She was merely aware of a crowd on all sides, merely heard a clamor from every direction, but it seemed to hold no meaning.
As she came through the crowd to the palace gate, a guard suddenly grabbed Vibha’s hand to stop her.
In that instant, Vibha was abruptly plunged into the external world.
She saw her surroundings and was mortified with shame.
Her veil had fallen; she quickly pulled it back over her head.
Rammohan was walking ahead; he turned back and glared at the guard.
Fernandez, who was nearby, came and gave the guard a thorough scolding.
Vibha entered the palace.
Like any other maidservant, Vibha entered the palace—no one welcomed her!
In the room, only the king and Ramai Bhand, the jester, were seated.
Upon entering the room, Vibha looked at the king’s face and fell to the ground at his feet.
The king, startled, stood up and asked, “Who are you?
A beggar woman—have you come seeking alms?”
Vibha raised her bowed head, and looking at the king's face with tear-filled eyes, said, “No, Maharaj, I have come to give away my everything.
I have come to surrender you into another’s hands and take my leave.”
Rammohan could not remain silent.
He came near and said, “Maharaj, your Mahishi—the princess of Jessore.”
Suddenly, Ramchandra Ray's heart seemed to jolt—but immediately, Ramai Bhand laughed, and glancing slyly at the king, said in a harsh voice, “Why, is your 'dada' no longer to your liking?”
A glimmer of compassion had awakened in Ramchandra Ray’s heart, yet at Ramai’s words, he let out a cruel laugh.
He thought that showing Vibha affection now might make him an object of ridicule.
A thousand thunderbolts seemed to strike Vibha's head.
She was utterly mortified with shame.
Closing her eyes, she thought to herself, “Oh Mother Earth, swallow me whole!”
Anguished, she looked around, casting a helpless glance at Rammohan's face!
Rammohan rushed forward, forcefully grabbed Ramai Bhand by the scruff of his neck, and threw him out of the room.
The king, enraged, said, “Rammohan, you dare to show such insolence before me!”
Trembling, Rammohan said, “Maharaj, I was insolent!
That wretch insulted your Mahishi, my lady mother!
What does he think he is doing?
I will have his head shaved, pour whey over it, and drive him from the city, or my name is not Rammohan!”
The king snapped at Rammohan, “Who is my Mahishi?
I do not know her!”
Vibha's face turned blue.
She pressed the end of her sari to her mouth, her whole body began to tremble violently, and finally, still trembling, Vibha fainted and fell to the floor.
Then Rammohan, with folded hands, said to the king, “Maharaj, my family has served your line for four generations.
I have cared for you since childhood.
Today you have insulted my lady mother, you have driven away the kingdom's Rajya-Lakshmi.
So today, I too am leaving your service.
I will spend my life serving my lady mother.
I will live by begging, but I will not even step into the shadow of this palace again.”
Saying this, Rammohan bowed to the king and then said to Vibha, “Come, mother, come!
Let us leave this place at once!
We cannot stay here a moment longer.”
Saying this, he lifted her and brought her out.
There were many palanquins near the gate; he placed the unconscious and exhausted Vibha into one of them and returned to the boat.
Vibha went to Kashi with Udayaditya.
There, she spent her life in charity, meditation, service to the gods, and in caring for her brother.
As long as Rammohan lived, he remained with them.
Sitaram also came to Kashi with his family and took refuge with Udayaditya.
The market in Chandradwip in front of which Vibha’s boat had moored is still known by the name: “Bou-Thakurani’s Market.”
